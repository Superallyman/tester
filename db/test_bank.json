      "question": "A 1.50 D uncorrected myope views an object at 25.0 cm. What degree of accommodation is required at the corneal plane to achieve a clear retinal image?",
      "options": [" +1.50 D  ", " +4.00 D  ", " +2.50 D   ", " +5.50 D  "],
      "answers": [" +2.50 D   "],
      "explanation": "An object located at 25.0 cm has a vergence demand of 1/0.25= 4.00 D. The above patient has a far point vergence of 1.50 and therefore only needs to accommodate +2.50 D to achieve a clear retinal image of the object (4.00 D- 1.50 D = +2.50 D). An uncorrected myope requires less accommodation to achieve a clear retinal image for a near target when compared to an emmetrope or a hyperope. For this reason many presbyopic myopes will remove their distance glasses to read in lieu of bifocal or progressive addition lenses."

      "answers": [" +6.00 D   "],
      "explanation": "The target requires +4.50 D of accommodation to be viewed clearly, which is determined by the taking the reciprocal of the target distance (in meters) (1/0.22= 4.55 D or +4.50 D). However, in addition to the target demand, he must also accommodate 1.50 D more as he is undercorrected by this amount at distance in order to ensure a clear retinal image."

      "explanation": "Because the patient is fully corrected for distance, the only value that is required to calculate the accommodative demand is the viewing distance of 18cm which is determined by taking the reciprocal of the target distance (in meters) yielding 1/0.18 = 5.56 D or +5.50 D."

      "answers": [" 7.25 D and 7.75 D   "],
      "explanation": "In order to determine the amplitude of accommodation, one must take the reciprocal of the blur point in meters. For the above example, 1/0.14 = 7.14 and 1/0.13 = 7.69. Do not forget to convert to meters!! Also, the question asked that the answer be rounded to the nearest 0.25 D. Be sure to read questions carefully to avoid careless mistakes.

      "question": "You are comparing the measurements of the back vertex power and front vertex power of a high plus lens using the lensometer. The back vertex lens power reads +8.50 -1.25 x 170. When you flip the glasses around to measure the front vertex power, what do you expect the cylinder axis to read?",
      "options": [" 080  ", " 100  ", " 170  ", " 010   "],
      "answers": [" 010   "],
      "explanation": "For higher-powered plus lenses, there is often a difference between the front and back vertex powers. This is due to the increased thickness of a plus lens. It is important to note that the cylinder axis for the front vertex power will be the mirror-image of the back vertex cylinder axis (therefore it is acceptable to refocus the lens by adjusting the cylinder wheel). For the example above, if the back vertex cylinder axis is 170, the mirror of this will be a cylinder axis of 010. &#10;This aforementioned fact is important because during the measurement of an add power of high plus lenses, one may not obtain an accurate reading of the add power because of this difference in vertex powers. Therefore, one must re-measure the distance power of the lens using the front vertex power and then measure the power through the near add. The difference between these two measurements will represent the most accurate add power."

      "answers": [" 11.50 diopters   "],
      "explanation": "To determine the amplitude of accommodation for each eye in adults, one eye is occluded while the subjective findings are left in place, and the patient is asked to focus on one or two lines above their visual acuity threshold on the reduced Snellen chart. The chart is brought closer to the patient until he reports that the line first becomes blurry. This measurement is repeated with the other eye; the results are then converted from cm to diopters, yielding the near point of accommodation. &#10;&#10;In younger patients, accommodation testing often cannot be performed in the phoropter because their amplitudes of accommodation are typically greater than 10cm (which is off of the scale of the phoropter rule). If the patient is not corrected with the subjective refractive data, this must be taken into consideration. For example, the above patient reported that the chart became blurry 10cm from his eyes; 1/0.20= 10.0 diopters. Because he is also a 1.50 diopter hyperope, he actually must accommodate an initial 1.50 diopters at near; therefore, this must be added to the initial measurement, rendering his true amplitude of accommodation as 11.50 diopters for both the right and left eyes."

      "question": "A patient with an AC/A ratio of 8/1 and 4 prism diopters of exophoria views a target at 6.0m and uses 1.0 diopter of accommodation. What is the MOST likely resulting heterophoria?",

      "answers": [" 4 prism diopters of esophoria   "],
      "explanation": "The AC/A ratio conveys the amount of change to convergence resulting from a change in accommodation. The patient's AC/A ratio is 8/1. Therefore, because the patient's accommodation system was altered by 1.00 diopter, it is expected that the patient's heterophoria will change by 8 prism diopters. Because the accommodative system is stimulated, one would expect the heterophoria to become less exophoric or more esophoric. Given the above values, the patient's initial heterophoria is 4 prism diopters of exophoria, the AC/A ratio is 8/1, and the patient experienced 1.00 diopter of accommodation; therefore, the resultant heterophoria would be 4 prism diopters of esophoria.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Accommodative System Norms"

For example, the above patient reported that the chart became blurry 20cm from her eyes; 1/0.20= 5.0 diopters.

      "question": "The near phoria at 40 cm for a patient wearing their spectacle lenses is 6 exophoria. +1.00 D is then placed over the patient's spectacles and the resulting phoria at 40 cm is measured as 9 exophoria. Based upon these clinical findings, what is the gradient AC/A ratio?",
      "options": [" 3/1   ", " 9/1  ", " 4/1  ", " 6/1  "],
      "answers": [" 3/1   "],
      "explanation": "The gradient AC/A ratio allows for the determination of the magnitude of change in the ocular deviation as a result of stimulation or relaxation of the accommodative system by the introduction of ophthalmic lenses. The patient is asked to view a target at near (typically 40 cm) through the lenses that achieve the best corrected visual acuity, and the phoria is measured. +1.00 or -1.00 is then placed in front of the ophthalmic corrective lenses and the resultant phoria is re-measured (some clinicians use a +3.00 D lens). Plus-powered lenses relax the accommodative system, resulting in a decrease in accommodative convergence, while minus-powered lenses stimulate the accommodative system, thereby causing increased accommodative convergence and an increased eso deviation or a decreased exo deviation. The resulting AC/A ratio is then determined via the following formula: gradient AC/A= (deviation-deviation with lens)/power of lens in diopters. For the above question, the gradient AC/A is calculated as follows: (6-9)/1=-3/1. Conventionally, a minus sign indicates an increase in exodeviation or a decrease in esodeviation. Typically, AC/A ratios are given in absolute values. &#10;&#10;Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus 2nd ed. Wright K. & Spiegel, P.

      "answers": [" 23 degrees   "],
      "explanation": "The medial and lateral walls of the orbit are positioned at an angle of 45 degrees from each other. The orbital axis then forms an angle of 22.5 degrees with the medial and lateral walls (for the sake of simplicity, this angle is usually regarded as 23 degrees). Therefore, in primary gaze, the visual axis also forms an angle of 23 degrees with the orbital axis. The actions of all of the extraocular muscles depend on the position of the eye as each undergoes contraction. The vertical recti muscles run along the same line as the orbital axis, thereby also creating an angle of 23 degrees with the visual axis at their attachment point anterior to the equator. When the globe is abducted 23 degrees, the vertical recti muscles act purely to elevate or depress the eye."

The patient was previously prescribed eye exercises but reports that he does not have time to perform them and wishes to purchase glasses with prism. Pertinent clinical findings include: Cover test 16 exophoria at 6 m and 4 exophoria at 40 cm. Vergences: Negative fusional convergence (NFC) at 6 m: x/12/8, Positive fusional convergence (PFC) at 6 m: x/4/2, Worth-4-Dot at 6 m: crossed diplopia that is neutralized with 6 base-in prism diopters.

      "explanation": "Divergence excess presents with a high exophoria (or intermittent exotropia) at far and a smaller amount of exophoria (with a difference in magnitude between the distance and near phoria of roughly 10 prism diopters) or orthophoria at near. The patient will demonstrate decreased distance second degree fusion (they may experience suppression or diplopia), a high AC/A ratio and decreased distance positive fusional vergence ranges. Patients will report occasional distance diplopia or suppression (therefore likely asymptomatic), an eye that turns out when looking at distant targets (usually this will be noted by friends or the patient's parents) or squinting/ closing one eye in bright illumination. Patients may also experience asthenopia. &#10;&#10;When attempting to determine the appropriate amount of prism to prescribe, the majority of clinicians will opt for the smallest amount of prism that allows for fused and confortable binocular viewing by the patient. In the above question, the patient reported fusion on the Worth-4-Dot test with the placement of 6 base-in prism. &#10;&#10;Some clinicians follow Sheard's criterion, which states that the compensating relative fusional vergence reserve (blur point) should be at least twice the magnitude of the deviation in order to maintain comfortable binocular vision. &#10;&#10;Reference: http://www.revoptom.com/content/d/ophthalmic_lenses_and_dispensary/c/15234/"

The objects can be static or moving but it is the rapid altering of fixation between the targets that is known as a saccade. A pursuit describes the event in which a person maintains foveal fixation on a single moving object. Pursuits tend to be smooth and fluid. A vergence is known as the situation in which the eyes move in opposite directions, as opposed to versions where the eyes both look left or right. In convergence both eyes turn in (nasal movement). With divergence both eyes turn outward (temporal movement). A phoria is known as the event that occurs when there is a deviation from conjugate gaze and occurs only in the absence of fusion."

      "explanation": "The inferior rectus muscle originates at the lower portion of the annulus of Zinn and courses to its insertion site, which lies 6.8mm behind the inferior region of the limbus. The primary action of the inferior rectus is depression of the globe; its secondary actions include adduction and extorsion. &#10;&#10;It is also important to note that when the globe is abducted 23 degrees, the inferior rectus will act solely as a depressor. This is the optimal position of the globe if one wants to isolate the action of the inferior rectus."

      "answers": [" Add +0.25 D to the right eye   "],
      "explanation": "Alternating occlusion is frequently utilized as a binocular balance test and is performed during subjective refraction. Once each eye has undergone refraction, +0.50 is added to the spherical findings of each eye for fogging purposes. A line with the patient's threshold visual acuity is used as a target, and the patient is asked if the vision in each eye appears equal or if one eye yields a clearer visual acuity when the eyes are alternately occluded. If the patient reports that one eye affords a sharper image, +0.25 D is added to that eye. This process is continued until reversal occurs (the clearer eye now sees a blurrier image when compared to the other eye) or the patient reports that the images appear equally clear. Once equality is achieved, the patient is unfogged binocularly to achieve maximal visual acuity."

      "answers": [" Duane Syndrome Type III OS   "],
      "explanation": "In this case, Duane Syndrome is suspected due to the presence of an extraocular muscle deficit and the additional sign of eye retraction and narrowing of the eyelid fissure. Duane Syndrome Type III is the most appropriate diagnosis due to the limited ADDuction of the affected eye on right gaze, along with the left head turn, which also implies limited ABDuction as well. &#10;Duane Syndrome Type I describes limited ABDuction of the affected eye (the most common) as well as a possible compensatory head turn toward the involved side. &#10;Duane Syndrome Type II describes limited ADDuction of the affected eye, as well as a possible compensatory head turn toward the uninvolved side. &#10;Duane Syndrome Type III describes limited ABDuction AND limited ADDuction of the affected eye. It also usually presents with a compensatory head turn toward the involved side. &#10;A good way to remember the difference between the three types is that type I results in an aBDuction deficit (aBDuction has one D therefore it is type I). &#10;Type II causes an aDDuction deficit (aDDuction has two Ds therefore it is type II). Type III has three Ds, aBDuction and aDDuction-the number of the types matches the number of Ds in the deficit. &#10;&#10;Brown syndrome describes a limitation of elevation in adduction. It is a limitation of the superior oblique tendon."

      "explanation": "Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) is an ocular condition that is commonly accompanied by a history of strabismus, most notably infantile esotropia. The exact etiology and pathophysiology of a dissociated vertical deviation is unknown; however, we do know that 'dissociation' refers to the idea that the innervation of one eye causes it to move involuntarily and independently of the contralateral eye. This process does not obey the common laws of innervation, in which both eyes typically move together. &#10;&#10;Characteristics of a dissociated vertical deviation include the presence of an up-drift with accompanying excyclorotation of the eye that can occur either spontaneously or when under cover (during a cover-test). When the cover is removed, the eye will then move down to fixation without a simultaneous corresponding down-drift of the fellow eye. This condition is most commonly bilateral, although it may be asymmetrical."

      "explanation": "The most notable of the exam findings is the near point of convergence (NPC) -generally one expects an NPC of less than 6cm (closer is better with NPC). Her NPC is receded to 15 cm. Normally, if patients display a receded NPC but they are asymptomatic, no treatment is necessary. In the above case, the patient is experiencing diplopia and asthenopia with prolonged near work which infers some type of intervention may be required (likely vision therapy). Brain tumors typically present as headaches that are present in the morning and worsen over a time period of weeks to months.

A version is characterized by movement of both eyes that is equal in magnitude and in the same direction (for example, looking to the left) for both eyes. A vergence is the movement of both eyes in opposite directions; for example, when reading a book, binocular fixation is maintained by convergence (the rotation of both eyes towards the mid-line). In the above question, the only example of a vergence would be the resulting convergence during evaluation of the NPC. Directing the patient's gaze superiorly or to the left are examples of versions. Placing prism over the patient's eyes can result in vergence but only if the prisms cause the image to move in different directions or unequal magnitudes for each eye. In the above instance, the prism will shift the image in the same direction for each eye, producing a version of equal magnitude for each eye in order to maintain fixation."

A version is a binocular eye movement in which the eyes move in the same direction and of equal magnitude. Infraversion is a movement where both eyes look downwards. Although during divergence, the right eye technically moves slightly to the right (away from the midline) and the left eye moves slightly to the left (away from the midline) these movements cannot be termed dextroversion and levoversion respectively as a version infers movement of the eyes in the same direction.

Assuming the patient possesses simultaneous perception, the right eye alone views the bottom and the top circle as red and pink/red respectively. The left eye views three green circles. Combined, both eyes view four circles, two appear green, one lower appears red and the upper one appears red/green. Three green circles viewed to the right of two red circles indicate crossed diplopia (exophoria). The perception of three green circles viewed to the left of two red circles is indicative of uncrossed diplopia (esophoria). The perception of three green circles alone is indicative of right eye suppression. If the patient reports viewing two red circles, this indicates suppression of the left eye."

      "options": [" Extortion of one eye and intorsion of the other  ", " Adduction of both eyes   ", " Intortion of both eyes  ", " Adduction of one eye and abduction of the other  ", " Abduction of both eyes  "],
      "answers": [" Adduction of both eyes   "],
      "explanation": "In vergence movements, the eyes move in opposite directions. In convergence, both eyes adduct (move medially). In divergence, both eyes abduct (move laterally). Intortion of both eyes is known as incyclovergence. If the left eye abducts and the right eye adducts, both eyes are moving to the patient's left; this is called levoversion. If the right eye abducts and the left eye adducts, both eyes are moving right and this is called dextroversion."

      "question": "During administration of the red lens test your patient initially reports a red light and a white light which then fuse and appear as a pink light after 5 seconds of viewing. This type of response is classified as what grade of fusion?",
      "options": [" Grade D  ", " Grade C  ", " Grade B   ", " Grade A  "],
      "answers": [" Grade B   "],
      "explanation": "Grade B fusion describes the event in which fusion is preceeded by momentary diplopia. Grade A fusion is the normal response and is depicted by instant fusion. Grade C fusion is defined as constant diplopia with the absence of fusion. Grade D is observed when one eye is suppressed or the eyes alternately suppress resulting in the perception of only one light at a time."

      "question": "Accommodative testing on your 8 year-old male patient while wearing his distance correction reveals the following: negative relative accommodation (NRA): +2.75 D; positive relative accommodation (PRA): -0.75. Amplitudes of accommodation are OD/OS respectively 7D/7D. Which of the following should be considered in the above patient's care when prescribing vision correction?",
      "options": [
        " He should be prescribed contact lenses in lieu of glasses  ",
        " He should be prescribed bifocal or progressive addition lenses (PALS)   ",
        " He should be prescribed CR-39 lenses because of his high ametropia  ",
        " He should be advised to remove his glasses when performing near activities  "
      ],
      "answers": [" He should be prescribed bifocal or progressive addition lenses (PALS)   "],
      "explanation": "Because the patient displays low accommodative capabilities (due to a low PRA and low amplitudes of accommodation), he should be prescribed a reading addition, whether it be via PALS or a bifocal lens. Patients with accommodative insufficiency will report blurry vision, headaches, avoidance or irritability, or a lack of concentration with sustained near tasks. Having the patient perform near activities through his full distance correction causes strain and stress on his accommodative system, resulting in the above symptoms. In the presence of decreased accommodative amplitudes (lower than what is expected for the patient's age) and low PRA readings, which indirectly measures fusional vergence (less than -1.50 D, taking into account the patient's age) it is best to prescribe a reading addition to decrease the strain on his accommodative system. For patients with lower amounts of ametropia it is appropriate to have them remove their glasses to read; however, in the above case the patient's near point is roughly 17cm (1/-5.75 OD only), and this is too close for the patient to hold his reading material/homework. Therefore, this is not an appropriate option for him. He should be prescribed polycarbonate lenses for both aesthetic and safety purposes. Lastly, although he would benefit from an increased field of view and less image minification if he were to be fit with contact lenses, the accommodative demand would be increased; and wearing of reading glasses over his contact lenses or bifocal contact lenses would be necessary to keep him symptom-free.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Accommodative System Norms"

      "answers": [" Increase esophoria or reduce the exophoria measured   "],
      "explanation": "Over-correction of myopia stimulates accommodation. As the viewing distance decreases, the eyes will converge reflexively (accommodative convergence). In addition to the expected accommodative convergence, there will be increased convergence as the eye accommodates to bring the target in focus compensating for the distance over-correction. This over-convergence will either cause increased esophoria or reduce the amount of exophoria present."

      "answers": [" Superior rectus subnuclei   "],
      "explanation": "The nuclear complex of the oculomotor nerve resides in the midbrain at the level of the superior colliculus. It is composed of paired and unpaired subnuclei that innervate their corresponding muscles on either the ipsilateral or contralateral sides. &#10;&#10;The medial rectus subnuclei, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique subnuclei are paired subnuclei (meaning that there is one on each side) and they innervate their corresponding muscles on the ipsilateral side. Lesions involving this area will result in ipsilateral medial rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique weakness. &#10;&#10;The superior rectus subnuclei are also paired; however, they innervate their respective contralateral superior rectus muscle. Therefore, a lesion affecting the third nerve nuclear complex will spare the ipsilateral superior rectus and will involve the contralateral superior rectus. &#10;&#10;The levator subnucleus is the only subnucleus that is unpaired. It lies in the caudal midline and innervates both levator muscles. Lesions in this area will result in bilateral ptosis."

      "answers": [" Superior oblique   "],
      "explanation": "The superior oblique muscle originates on the lesser wing of the sphenoid near the frontoethmoid suture. The tendon of insertion begins about 1 cm behind the trochlea (a U-shaped piece of cartilage attached to the orbital plate of the frontal bone) and changes directions as it passes through the trochlea to run in a posterior direction, causing the trochlea to act as the effective origin of the superior oblique muscle, acting as a pulley. The superior oblique muscle is innervated by the trochlear nerve (CN IV)."

      "question": "A 57-year old woman has developed signs of ophthalmoplegia, maxillary sensory loss, and a fixed dilated pupil. These signs are most consistent with damage to which of the following structures?",
      "options": [" Internal auditory meatus  ", " Crus cerebri  ", " Cavernous sinus   ", " Annulus of Zinn  ", " Supraorbital foramen  "],
      "answers": [" Cavernous sinus   "],
      "explanation": "The cavernous sinus is a large venous channel on each side of the body of the sphenoid extending from the medial end of the superior orbital fissure to the petrous portion of the temporal bone and lateral to the sella turcica. The internal carotid artery and the abducens nerve (CN VI) are located within the medial portion of the sinus. The oculomotor (CN III), trochlear (CN IV), ophthalmic, and maxillary branches of the trigeminal (CN V) are found within the lateral portion. The cavernous sinus is the only location where an artery travels through a venous structure such that a rupture of the internal carotid artery within the cavernous sinus creates an arteriovenous fistula. Cavernous sinus syndrome usually results from pituitary masses or other masses compressing this region although it can also occur secondary to infectious, inflammatory, vascular, or traumatic causes that disrupt the nerves travelling through the sinus causing ophthalmoplegia, maxillary sensory loss, and a fixed, dilated pupil. Tolusa-Hunt syndrome (THS) is an inflammatory condition within the cavernous sinus or superior orbital fissure causing damage to the structures in those regions. &#10;&#10;The internal auditory (or acoustic) meatus is a canal in the petrous portion of the temporal bone through which the facial (CN VII) and vestibulocochlear nerves (CN VIII) and the labyrinthine artery travel. Damage to these structures can result in deafness and facial muscle paralysis. Acoustic neuromas will commonly expand the internal auditory meatus and damage these structures. Other signs may include tinnitus or vertigo. &#10;&#10;The crus cerebri is the anterior portion of the cerebral peduncle containing the efferent motor tracts. Damage to the crus cerebri usually results in paralysis to a region of the body. The other tract of the cerebral peduncles is the tegmentum. This coordinates movement and when damaged, results in jerky movements. &#10;&#10;The supraorbital foramen lies under the eyebrow above the orbit and transmits the supraorbital nerve, artery, and vein. It is believed by some to be an important acupressure point for relief of headache pain. &#10;&#10;The annulus of Zinn, also known as the common tendinous ring, is a ring of fibrous tissue around the optic nerve where it enters at the apex of the orbit. It is the origin of several of the extraocular muscles. The annulus of Zinn can be divided into an upper and lower portion. The lower portion is known as the ligament (or tendon) of Zinn which gives rise to the rectus inferior and part of the rectus internus and rectus lateralis. The upper portion is known as the superior tendon of Lockwood and is the origin of the rectus superior, rectus medialis, and part of the rectus lateralis."

The lateral rectus is innervated by cranial nerve VI (the abducens). The superior oblique is controlled by cranial nerve IV (trochlear nerve). &#10;&#10;A cranial nerve III palsy will result in an eye that appears down (hypotropia) and out (exotropia) with a large ptosis, which may or may not be accompanied by a dilated pupil.

      "explanation": "Angle kappa represents the angle subtended by the visual and anatomical axes of the eye. The visual axis is a line that passes from the center of the fovea, through the nodal point of the eye, and to the point of fixation. The anatomical axis of the eye is a line that passes from the center of the posterior pole through the center of the cornea. Because of the fact that the fovea is typically slightly temporal to the anatomical center of the eye, these 2 axes do not usually line up perfectly. The difference between these is angle kappa. Angle kappa is commonly about 5 degrees and is positive when the fovea is aligned temporally to the center of the posterior pole (resulting in a nasal displacement of the corneal reflex)."

      ],
      "answers": [" Add +0.25 D over the right eye   "],
      "explanation": "The bichrome test is performed by occluding one eye and projecting letters on a red and green background. The patient is initially fogged by roughly + 0.50 D. Fogging over-plusses the patient and shifts the chromatic interval forwards (causing objects projected on a background with longer wavelengths (red) to be bolder) such that the patient should report that the letters are blacker and bolder on the red side of the chart. The addition of minus lenses should equate the two sides such that the letters appear equally black and bold on the red and green sides. If the patient initially reports that the letters on the green side are bolder, then either plus lenses need to be added or minus powered lenses need to be reduced to shift the chromatic interval forwards. If the patient does not report equal boldness/blackness/sharpness of the letters on the green and red sides of the chart but instead instantly reports reversal upon switching lenses, the majority of clinicians will leave the power of the lens in the phoropter at the setting where the patient last reported that the letters on the red side of the chart appeared bolder/blacker to minimize the chances of over-minussing the patient. &#10;&#10;Clinical Optics and Refraction.

      "answers": [" Duane's retraction syndrome   "],
      "explanation": "Duane's retraction syndrome occurs as a result of a developmental error in innervation of the lateral rectus muscle. The sixth cranial nerve fails to innervate the lateral rectus muscle, while at the same time fibers from the third cranial nerve inappropriately innervate the lateral rectus. It is common for this dysinnervation to affect both eyes; however, the involvement of one eye tends to be much more subtle. &#10;&#10;The clinical signs leading to the diagnosis of this condition include the following extraocular motility defects of the affected eye: &#10;- Restricted abduction, which may be partial or complete. &#10;- Restricted adduction, which is usually partial. &#10;- This occurs secondary to opposing muscles (lateral and medial recti) being innervated by the same nerve, limiting the eye's ability to move. &#10;- Retraction of the globe on adduction, which occurs as a result of co-contraction of the medial and lateral rectus muscles, leading to narrowing of the palpebral fissure; on abduction the globe will assume its natural position and the palpebral fissure will open. &#10;- Up-shoots or down-shoots on attempted adduction can occur in some cases. This is thought to be caused by a tight lateral rectus muscle that can slip either over or under the globe, producing an anomalous vertical movement of the eye upon co-contraction of the medial and lateral recti. &#10;- Convergence deficiency, in which the affected eye remains fixed in primary position while the contralateral eye converges."

      "explanation": "Thyroid-related orbitopathy associated with Grave's disease (hyperthyroidism) manifests itself through several pathologic features, including the progressive enlargement of the extraocular muscles. This inflammation is mediated through release of cytokines, fibroblast proliferation, increased deposition of extracellular matrix, and differentiation and proliferation of adipocytes, and tends to target the muscles of the eye. Studies have shown that the inferior rectus muscle is preferentially affected in these patients, often resulting in diplopia on upgaze. The second most commonly affected muscle is the medial rectus, followed by the superior rectus then lateral rectus (obliques are rarely targeted). These patients often experience diplopia, proptosis, and orbital pain, and may require surgical intervention. &#10;&#10;An easy way to remember the order of affected muscles in thyroid eye diseases is 'I MuScLes': Inferior, Medial, Superior, Lateral."

      "answers": [" Better control of the patient's accommodative response   "],
      "explanation": "Cycloplegic agents are used to inhibit the action of the ciliary body, thereby essentially temporarily eliminating the ability to accommodate. A cycloplegic refraction/retinoscopy is useful for non-verbal, non-cooperative, or non-responsive patients. In the event that the patient's reflex fluctuates during retinoscopy, retinoscopy reveals more 'plus power' than the refraction, or the patient's visual acuity is less than expected in the absence of pathology or developmental issues, cycloplegic drops should be instilled. The drops should also be used if the patient is esotropic or if latent hyperopia is suspected. When performing cycloplegic retinoscopy/refraction, it is important to focus on the center of the pupil, as spherical aberrations increase with pupil mydriasis; this can make it difficult to obtain an accurate retinoscopy assessment as well as cause difficulty with axis refinement. &#10;&#10;Ophthalmic Clinical Procedures: A Multimedia Guide.

      "explanation": "MEM measures the accuracy of the accommodative response to a given target. Monocular amplitudes and monocular facility also evaluate the performance of the accommodative system. &#10;&#10;PFC measures the interaction between the accommodative and the vergence system. &#10;&#10;Stereopsis is a product of binocular retinal disparity. Stereopsis is not a measure of accommodation but serves to evaluate the capability of the eyes to work in unison. Although accommodation must be accounted for when performing this test, stereopsis will not quantify any type of accommodative dysfunction. Stereopsis as a cue to depth works best if the objects are not too far away. In order for stereopsis to occur, the retinal disparity must be within a certain limit to result in a perception of depth. &#10;&#10;Second-degree fusion is the ability to superimpose like objects (not necessarily identical objects), with the end result being the perception of a single object that is a composition of the two separate images. The Worth 4 dot is an example of a test that evaluates second-degree fusion.

      "answers": [" Von Graefe's sign   "],
      "explanation": "Von Graefe's sign occurs in Grave's disease (thyroid dysfunction). This term refers to the incomplete ability of the eyelid to move down when the globe is directed in a down gaze. It is often described as a lagging of the upper eyelid-not because it sags but because it lags behind movement-wise. The greater the down gaze, the greater the bearing of the sclera. Von Graefe's sign results from excessive innervation of the sympathetic system which causes upper lid retraction via the muscle of Mueller. &#10;&#10;Collier's sign is also known as a tucked lid due to extreme upper lid retraction in primary gaze which stems from a lesion of cranial nerve III at the posterior commissure. This is very rare. &#10;&#10;Myerson's sign occurs in people who are suffering from Parkinson's disease and in all infants younger than 2 months of age. Most people when tapped between the eyes can inhibit themselves from blinking. Patients with Parkinson's cannot inhibit the facial reflex and will always blink, which is referred to as Myerson's sign. The facial reflex is as follows: tap proximal to orbit-> ophthalmic division or maxillary division of trigeminal (depends on the location of tapping) ->midbrain->pons->stimulation of orbicularis, inhibition of levator palpebrae superioris. &#10;&#10;Horner's syndrome results from a disruption of the sympathetic innervation to the eye either due to a lesion or mass located either post-ganglionically or pre-ganglionically. The classic triad of signs seen in a patient suffering from Horner's syndrome is miosis, a small ptosis and anhidrosis (lack of sweat) on one side of the head."

      "explanation": "Forced vergence fixation disparity curves are used to evaluate the efficiency of a patient's disparity vergence system by observing how fixation disparity changes when different amounts of base-in and base-out prism are introduced to the eyes. &#10;&#10;Patients with fusional vergence dysfunction typically exhibit the following: &#10;°Normal phorias at distance and near &#10;°Normal AC/A ratio &#10;°Reduced positive fusional vergence and negative fusional vergence at both distance and near &#10;°Reduced positive relative accommodation and negative relative accommodation (indirect measurement of fusional vergence) &#10;°Reduced accommodative facility &#10;&#10;Studies have shown that the prevalence of fusional vergence dysfunction is just under that of convergence excess and convergence insufficiency (1-2%). Patients often first notice this problem when asthenopia occurs, usually at near.

      "explanation": "When performing the monocular cross cylinder balance test, there should be no more than 0.50 D difference between the eyes. If the resultant difference is higher, then one should re-balance the subjective refraction as one eye is likely over-accommodating. Even if the patient does require unequal adds, given the above results one should first confirm by re-checking the subjective refraction balance. It is very rare that a patient requires unequal adds. Lastly, anisometropia will not affect the results for the monocular crossed cylinder test (unless a large degree of amblyopia is present). Any anisometropia should have been discovered and balanced in the subjective refraction."

      "explanation": "There are four known involuntary accommodative stimuli. Reflexive or defocus stimulates accommodation in the presence of retinal defocus (when the image on the retina is blurred). Proximal cues also stimulate the accommodative system. This type of stimulus occurs when there is an increased awareness of a near target. This can result from visual cues such as overlap, increased visual angle and brightness to name a few. The third involuntary stimulus to accommodation is tonic. This stimulus is present in the absence of visual stimulation and derived from baseline neural innervation. Tonic accommodation tends to increase in the dark to a resting state of 1.00 to 1.50 D. This state is occasionally referred to as the dark focus of accommodation. Lastly, convergence is another type of involuntary accommodative stimulus. When convergence is stimulated, so is the accommodation system."

      "answers": [" Right hyper deviation or left hypo deviation   "],
      "explanation": "When performing the Von Graefe method, a 4 base up dissociating prism is placed before the left eye and an 18 base in prism (biasing prism) is placed before the right eye. A single letter or target is projected at far (or near). The patient should initially perceive two targets with one being up and to the right and the other down and to the left . The 4 base up prism is then slowly reduced (either via intermittent occlusion or no occlusion) until the patient reports that the two targets are directly beside one another lined up horizontally. When the targets are aligned horizontally, the amount of prism before the left eye is recorded. If there is base up prism in front of the left eye then the deviation is described as either right hyperphoria or left hypophoria in the amount equal to the neutralizing prism before the left eye."

      "explanation": "Levodepression is the movement of each eye into down and left gaze. This position of gaze is considered one of the six cardinal positions, in which a single muscle of each eye is responsible for moving the eye into that particular direction. In the case of levodepression, the right eye moves down and nasally by the action of the right superior oblique, while the left eye moves down and temporally, due to contraction of the left inferior rectus muscle."

      "explanation": "This patient presents with accommodative spasm. Her lead of accommodation found on MEM and her NRA are the most pertinent clinical findings. Additionally, symptoms of intermittent near to distance vision hints at accommodative dysfunction. The patient also fits the patient population most correlated with accommodative spasm, i.e. young teenage females. The patient's entering visual acuities correlate with her wet subjective findings and so should be fully corrected in her glasses to optimize her distance vision. A +1.00 add is needed to keep her focusing system relaxed with near activities, and as such, should be included in her spectacle prescription. There is no preference or advantage to having a lined bifocal or a progressive additional lens. &#10;&#10;Spectacle Prescription: OD: -0.50 DS OS: -0.50 DS. This answer is incorrect since an add is needed to help keep the focusing system relaxed. &#10;&#10;Spectacle Prescription: Over-the-counter +1.00 DS OU. This answer is incorrect because OTC Reading glasses would be insufficient, since the patient also presents with blurry distance vision and myopia, even upon cycloplegic examination. &#10;&#10;Spectacle Prescription: OD: plano DS OS: plano DS +2.50 add &#10;This prescription is not valid as the patient needs myopic correction for distance, as seen with wet subjective findings. The +2.50 add is too high, as her NRA is +1.00.

      "explanation": "Studies have shown that longitudinal chromatic aberration (LCA) plays a very important role in how the eyes detect defocus, resulting in an accommodative response. There is a significant amount of LCA present in the human eye; this occurs due to the fact that the refractive index of any medium (other than a vacuum) varies with wavelength. Therefore, shorter wavelengths (blues) will bend more as they pass through a lens, while longer wavelengths (reds) bend less. This leads to a variation in the image location, also known as LCA. If the LCA is removed by using monochromatic light or by optically neutralizing the LCA, it has been proven that a significant disruption occurs in the normal reflex accommodative response. &#10;&#10;Adaptive Optics for Vision Science: Principles, Practices, Design, and Applications.

      "question": "A 47-year old man sustained orbital trauma and now presents with complaints of retro-orbital pain, impaired ability to move the eye, a droopy eyelid, and diplopia. These signs are most consistent with damage to which of the following structures?",
      "options": [" Stylomastoid foramen  ", " Internal auditory meatus  ", " Superficial temporal artery  ", " Superior orbital fissure   "],
      "answers": [" Superior orbital fissure   "],
      "explanation": "The superior orbital fissure is a cleft between the lesser and greater wings of the sphenoid. Structures traveling through the superior orbital fissure include the oculomotor nerve (CN III), trochlear nerve (CN IV), abducens nerve (CN VI), lacrimal nerve, frontal nerve, nasociliary nerve, and the ophthalmic vein (superior and inferior divisions). These structures can be damaged when there is orbital trauma causing fractures through the floor of the orbit into the maxillary sinus. This leads to superficial orbital fissure syndrome (also known as Rochon-Duvigneaud's syndrome). Signs include paralysis of extraocular muscles, diplopia, ptosis, exophthalmia and decreased sensation of the upper eyelid and forehead. Vision loss or blindness implies a more serious injury involving the orbital apex (orbital apex syndrome). &#10;&#10;Tolusa-Hunt syndrome (THS) is an inflammatory condition within the cavernous sinus or superior orbital fissure causing damage to the structures in those regions. Signs are usually acute and unilateral at onset in adults and the most common presenting signs are pain and ophthalmoparesis. &#10;&#10;The internal auditory (or acoustic) meatus is a canal in the petrous portion of the temporal bone through which the facial (CN VII) and vestibulocochlear nerves (CN VIII) and the labyrinthine artery travel. Damage to these structures can result in deafness and facial muscle paralysis. Acoustic neuromas will commonly expand the internal auditory meatus and damage these structures. Other signs may include tinnitus or vertigo. &#10;&#10;The stylomastoid foramen is the termination of the facial canal between the styloid and mastoid processes of the temporal bone. The facial nerve and stylomastoid artery travel through this area. Damage to this area can result in facial drooping and paralysis. Bell's palsy (idiopathic facial nerve paralysis) is an inflammatory condition that may lead to swelling of the facial nerve in this region. &#10;&#10;The superficial temporal artery is a major artery arising from the bifurcation of the external carotid artery. The artery begins within the parotid salivary gland and passes over the zygomatic process of the temporal bone. It is often affected in cases of giant cell arteritis (which is also known as temporal arteritis for this reason). This condition is a vasculitis of the medium and large arteries of the head and is not necessarily restricted to the temporal artery. Temporal arteritis is seen predominantly in older patients and is characterized by fever, headache, sensitivity on the scalp, jaw pain, reduced visual acuity or vision loss, diplopia, and acute tinnitus. Due to potentially rapid progressive vision loss, this disease is a medical emergency. Treatment usually consists of high-dose corticosteroids."

      "answers": [" The distance prescription is over-minussed   "],
      "explanation": "Negative relative accommodation (NRA) and positive relative accommodation (PRA) should be fairly balanced, and they should not be greater than the overall amplitude of accommodation. The PRA is commonly high in young adults as they possess good accommodative skills. In presbyopes the range of relative accommodation is much more limited (due to the fact that accommodative ability is diminished). The above findings suggest that the patient has been over-minussed in the distance and therefore the NRA and PRA are imbalanced. Because the patient is over-minussed he or she will tend to require more plus powered lenses to compensate for the diminished ability to stimulate accommodation which will manifest as an imbalanced range of relative accommodation, with the NRA being asymmetrically higher. &#10;&#10;Based upon the above findings, the add power should not be adjusted as the patient is capable of reading RS 20 with a tentative add in place. One should always try to prescribe the least amount of power that achieves good near vision. Otherwise, the greater the near power, the closer the focal point and most people prefer to maintain a good range of clarity at near without having to hold objects too close to them. Once the distance prescription is re-evaluated, in this instance, one would also have to re-evaluate the tentative add which would likely decrease due to compensation for originally over-minussing the distance prescription."

      "answers": [" The parasympathetic system   "],
      "explanation": "Accommodation is innervated by the parasympathetic system. During accommodation, the parasympathetic system causes contraction of the ciliary muscles which decreases the tension on the zonules causing the lens to become more spherically shaped thereby increasing its dioptric power. Another theory suggests that ciliary body contraction increases the mass in the vitreous which causes the vitreous to push the lens forward. &#10;&#10;The sympathetic nervous system is primarily responsible for bodily functions in the presence of heightened awareness, danger or excitement and it prepares the body for fight-or-flight. &#10;&#10;The parasympathetic system is generally in charge of basic housekeeping tasks when the body is at rest. This system essentially tells the body to slow down. &#10;&#10;The somatic division of the peripheral nervous system is responsible for motor function and serves to convey information to and from skeletal muscles, tendons and skin. This division works closely with the autonomic system which relays signals to visceral organs such as the heart and gut. &#10;&#10;The lymphatic system plays a large role in the immune system."

      "explanation": "The near point of convergence (NPC) is the point in which the patient's eyes are maximally converged. The NPC is determined by presenting the patient with an appropriate accommodative target at near and with the patient's near correction in place, the patient is asked to keep the target clear and single. The target is then brought closer to the patient until either the patient reports that the image of the object appears double or the clinician notes that one of the patient's eyes turns out. This point is measured and recorded from the spectacle plane in centimeters. While performing the NPC, the convergence system maintains fusion of the target and accommodation sustains clarity. Some patients may report blurring of the target (near point of accommodation) prior to experiencing diplopia, but rarely do patients report blurring of the target after experiencing diplopia. The majority of clinicians record 'TTN' or 'to the nose' for patients who do not report diplopia or do not exhibit a break in fusion."

This is known as a lag of accommodation. This type of study can be done by placing negative trial lenses with increasing power in front of the eyes (stimulating accommodation), while measuring the accommodative response with a refractometer. As the stimulus is increased and plotted, the linear response will have a slope of less than 1 due to the observed lag of accommodation. Eventually, there comes a point in which the maximum accommodative response amplitude is reached. It is also important to note that there is typically an initial small lead in accommodation (the response is greater than the stimulus) for low magnitudes of accommodative stimuli. &#10;&#10;Adler's Physiology of the Eye 11th Edition.

      "answers": [" The Modified Thorington method   "],
      "explanation": "The modified Thorington technique is performed by placing the test card at 40 cm. A Maddox rod is then introduced over the right eye or left eye with its axis oriented horizontally. The eye with the Maddox rod is occluded while a penlight is directed through the hole in the center of the card; the patient should report seeing a light and some letters and numbers. It is important that these targets should remain clear throughout the entire test. Next, un-occlude the eye with the Maddox rod; the patient should now see a red vertical streak (assuming the Maddox rod is over the right eye) that is superimposed upon the Thorington card. Direct the patient's gaze towards the spot of light and ask the patient to note which letters or numbers the horizontal streak is closest to. Flash the pen light on and off each time, asking the patient to inform you where the streak is located. Continue flashing the penlight until two consistent responses are obtained. If the patient has an exo deviation, s/he will report seeing a vertical streak to the left of the spot of light (Maddox rod over the right eye). If the Maddox rod is over the left eye, the streak will be seen to the right of the spot of light. Each optotype represents a one-prism diopter result. &#10;&#10;The Von Graefe method utilizes prism to produce dissociation between the eyes. The Mohindra method is a technique utilized by some clinicians when performing retinoscopy. Mohindra retinoscopy purportedly achieves results similar to cycloplegic retinoscopy without the use of pharmaceuticals. Randot stereoacuity is a measure of third-degree fusion and does not require the use of a Maddox rod. The Hess-Lancaster test uses red-green glasses to evaluate the position of each eye in the nine primary positions of gaze and is used to document/detect ocular paresis."

Reading through minus-powered lenses causes an increase in the accommodative response as well as the vergence system, resulting in less exophoria or more esophoria at near. If enough esophoria is induced, symptoms of asthenopia can occur. For patients with mild amounts of myopia, the removal of their glasses while performing near, visually oriented tasks will typically eliminate ocular discomfort. Other options include prescribing a bifocal or a progressive addition lens (PAL). Research has demonstrated that myopic patients who possess esophoria at near may benefit from a bifocal or PAL, which may serve to slow down the rate of progression of myopia. &#10;&#10;Primary Care Optometry 5th edition.

      "answers": [" The patient has an exophoria of 8 prism diopters   "],
      "explanation": "When performing the Von Graefe method, a 6 base up prism is placed before the left eye (dissociating prism) and a 12 base in prism (biasing prism) is placed before the right eye. A single letter or target is projected at far (or near). The patient should initially perceive two targets, with one being up and to the right and the other down and to the left (if the upper one is to the left, more base in prism needs to be added as the initial phoria is greater than 12 prism diopters). The 12 base in prism is then slowly reduced (either via intermittent occlusion or no occlusion) until the patient reports that the two targets are directly above one another lined up vertically. If there is base in prism before the right eye, the deviation is categorized as exo by the amount of prism before the right eye. If there is base out prism in front of the right eye, the deviation is eso equal to the amount of neutralizing prism before the right eye."

      ],
      "answers": [" Objects that appear double lie outside of Panum's fusional area   "],
      "explanation": "The patient in the above question is experiencing normal physiologic diplopia. There is an imaginary plane that exists in external space called the horopter, which represents all points that stimulate corresponding retinal elements. Any object that lands along the horopter will be fused and seen as a single image and in the same plane as the point of fixation. In addition to the horopter, there is a zone that lies both in front of and behind the horopter whereby objects stimulate slightly non-corresponding retinal points; this is known as retinal disparity. Objects within this area are also observed as single images; however, the disparity information is used to produce a binocular perception of depth, or stereopsis. Physiological diplopia is based on this idea; therefore, objects that lie outside of Panum's fusional area will be perceived as double. However, many patients will exhibit physiological suppression and are unaware of this phenomenon. &#10;&#10;In summary, objects along the horopter are seen singly and in the same plane; objects within Panum's fusional area are seen singly and stereoscopically; and objects that are outside of Panum's fusional area will appear double."

Although it is ideal if the visual acuities are equal between the eyes (certain binocular balance tests cannot be performed unless the eyes possess equal acuities), the main function of balance testing is to confirm equal accommodation between the eyes. The presence of a tropia and ocular alignment are typically determined via cover testing or by other methodologies. Many patients do not possess symmetrical refractive errors between the eyes and, therefore, attempting to achieve equality of the refractive errors can be detrimental to the visual acuity and comfort afforded by the prescription.

      "answers": [" Horizontal saccadic eye movements   "],
      "explanation": "Horizontal saccadic eye movements first emerge at birth and continue to develop until roughly 24 months. Vertical saccades require a longer time to mature and emerge at around 2 months of age and continue to develop until about 24 months. Pursuits may be seen as early as 2 months but are more commonly evident at 4 months of age. Stereopsis is absent at birth and does not become apparent until 3-5 months of age (some sources quote 4-6 months), reaching adult levels at 5-7 years of age. &#10;&#10;References: Optometric Clinical Practice Guideline Pediatric Eye and Vision Examination, Reference Guide for Clinicians.

      "question": "Which of the following methods for measuring a heterophoria is classified PRIMARILY as dissociating?",
      "options": [" Von Graefe method   ", " Bruckner testing  ", " Modified Thorington method  ", " The Hirschberg method  "],
      "answers": [" Von Graefe method   "],
      "explanation": "Dissociating methods cause diplopia with prism thereby enabling the clinician to quantify a phoria. The Von Graefe method is considered dissociating. This technique is performed by placing a 4 base-up dissociating prism before the left eye and a base-in prism (biasing prism) before the right eye. A single letter or target is projected at far (or near). The patient should initially perceive two targets, with one being up and to the right and the other down and to the left. The 4 base-up prism is then slowly reduced (either via intermittent occlusion or no occlusion) until the patient reports that the two targets are directly beside one another and lined up horizontally. When the targets are aligned horizontally, the amount of prism before the left eye is recorded. If there is base-up prism in front of the left eye, then the deviation is described as either right hyperphoria or left hypophoria in the amount equal to the neutralizing prism before the left eye. &#10;&#10;Distortion methods blur one or both retinal images such that the reflex for binocular fusion is eliminated. The Modified Thorington method utilizes a Maddox rod to create distortion. The Hirschberg test is uses the position of the corneal reflexes relative to the center of the pupil to determine the presence or absence of a heterotropia. Temporal displacement of the corneal reflex suggests esotropia, while nasal displacement infers exotropia. The Bruckner reflex test is used to denote an asymmetry between the brightness of the retinal reflexes that may be caused by strabismus, anisometropia, anisocoria, or certain pathologies such as a large retinal detachment or retinoblastoma. In the event of strabismus, the deviated eye will appear brighter because more light is reflected from the retinal periphery."

      "question": "A 22 year-old male presents with a history of a right orbital medial wall fracture and restriction in right gaze on extraocular muscle testing. Which of the following additional tests is MOST useful in determining whether the limitation is secondary to muscle entrapment or muscle paralysis?",
      "options": [" X-ray imaging  ", " Visual evoked potential  ", " Cover test  ", " Electrooculogram  ", " Exophthalmometry  ", " Forced duction testing   "],
      "answers": [" Forced duction testing   "],
      "explanation": "Forced duction testing is an in-office procedure that is used in differentiating between muscle weakness and restrictive causes of limitations in extraocular muscle movements. This test is typically performed when a patient is anesthetized using topical eye drops. The patient is then instructed to look as far as possible in the direction of the muscle that is suspected of underacting such that maximum innervation is recruited to that muscle. The examiner will then use forceps in order to grasp the conjunctiva as close to the area of the limbus as possible, opposite the side of gaze restriction. If the forceps can then rotate the globe further than where the patient can move it on his own, some degree of muscle paresis is likely. However, if the globe cannot be rotated farther, restriction or entrapment of the muscle is probable. For example, if the patient has a deficit in superior gaze, the insertion of the inferior rectus muscle should be topically anesthetized. The patient's gaze should then be directed upwards and the inferior rectus muscle should be grasped with forceps. Further superior rotation of the eye should then be attempted. Resistance is considered a positive forced duction test, while effortless rotation is deemed a negative forced duction test."

      "answers": ["Dry cough"],
      "explanation": "Ace-inhibitors (end with '-pril') &#10;Juxtaglomerular cells release RENIN when it discovers a drop in BP. RENIN goes to the liver and converts Angiotensin into Angiotensin 1 which floats over to the lungs (where ACE is) and it convert AG1 to AG2. AG2 enacts a physiologic change that results in: INCREASED BP, (increased thirst --^water intake), (constricts BVs --^pressure), (stims outer layer of adrenal cortex (glomerlaris) to secrete ALDOSTERONE (which acts on distal tubules of kidneys to reabsorb Na into blood -- increased osmosis into BVs). &#10;"

      "explanation": "Visuoscopy is an excellent technique to evaluate for eccentric fixation. This is performed by using the cross-hair target of your direct ophthalmoscope and projecting it onto the macula of the unoccluded eye. The patient is asked to fixate on the center of the target. No eccentric fixation is present if the foveal reflex aligns with the center of the cross-hairs. If the foveal reflex is to the left of the center (for the right eye), then the patient has nasal eccentric fixation. If the foveal reflex is located to the right of the target center, the patient possesses temporal eccentric fixation. The opposite holds true for the left eye (if the foveal reflex is to the right of the target center, the patient has nasal eccentric fixation). If the foveal reflex is located above the target, then the patient has inferior eccentric fixation, whereas a foveal reflex below the target is classified as superior eccentric fixation. &#10;In order to calculate the amount of eccentric fixation, you will have to know that from the center of the circle on the visuoscopy target to the edge of the circle is one prism diopter, and then each hash mark away from the center circle is an additional prism diopter. Therefore, the above patient has a total of 4 prism diopters of eccentric fixation (1 to the edge of the circle, and 3 for each additional hash mark)."

This prescription is quite low and will not result in amblyopia if left uncorrected during the critical period. Meridional amblyopia is caused when lines of a certain orientation are in focus to a greater degree than lines of another orientation. For example, the above prescription of -0.25-4.25x178 will cause lines in the vertical meridian to be in focus (remember that the power is 90 degrees away from the axis), while lines that are horizontal will appear blurry. This person may have difficulty with optotypes containing horizontal components like the letter E.

      "question": "When performing a unilateral cover test on your patient, you note the following: upon covering the right eye, the left eye moves in 1/10 times. Upon covering the left eye, the right eye moves in 4/10 times. The alternating cover test measures 25 prism diopters base-in. What is your diagnosis based on these findings?",

      ],
      "answers": [" 25 prism diopter intermittent alternating exotropia; left eye preferred   "],
      "explanation": "The unilateral cover test will tell you the eye (or eyes) affected, the direction, and the frequency of the ocular deviation. In this case, the eyes lose fixation 5/10 times, which shows that the frequency is intermittent (it would be constant if at least 1 eye moved 10/10 times). Since each eye moves at least once when the other is covered, the deviation is considered to be alternating. The uncovered eye is noted to move 'in' on unilateral cover test, meaning that the deviation is an exotropia (if the eye moves 'out' it is an esotropia). Since the right eye loses fixation more than the left eye (4/10 vs. 1/10), the left eye is considered to be the preferred eye. Also, the alternating cover test will tell you the full amount of the deviation, which is 25 prism diopters in this case."

      ],
      "answers": [" A four-year old boy with an uncorrected refractive error of OD: +6.00 DS and OS: +1.50 DS   "],
      "explanation": "A prescription in which there is a big refractive difference between the eyes, especially if both eyes are hyperopic, is most likely to cause amblyopia. Consider the prescription of OD: +6.00 DS and OS: +1.50 DS. The left eye will be able to accommodate 1.50 diopters to obtain a clear distance image and, because accommodation is bilateral and equal, the right eye will still be 4.50 diopters out of focus. This defocus will cause the left eye to dominate the cortical neurons, causing a decreased amount of binocular neurons and leading to poor stereopsis and amblyopia of the right eye. &#10;&#10;A prescription of OD: -3.25 DS and OS:-0.75 DS will not lead to amblyopia because even though the right eye is blurry in the distance, at 30 cm its image will be clear and in focus. This also applies to the prescription of OD: +1.50 DS and OS:-2.00 DS. Although both patients will have good monocular corrected acuities, they will most likely possess poor stereopsis due to a decreased amount of binocular neurons because the eyes are never in focus at the same distance. &#10;&#10;It is important to note that in order for amblyopia to occur, ametropia must be present during the critical period."

      "question": "The mother of a 6 year-old female reports that her daughter's right eye seems to turn out occasionally. A unilateral cover test performed at near reveals a tropia that is neutralized with 4 prism diopters base-in in upgaze, 10 prism diopters base-in in primary gaze, and 16 prism diopters base-in in downgaze.

      "answers": [" A-pattern exotropia   "],
      "explanation": "An A-pattern exotropia is an incomitant ocular deviation in which there exists a significant difference in the magnitude of an exotropia when measured in up-gaze and down-gaze (typically greater than 10 prism diopters). The ocular deviation is less apparent in up-gaze and becomes more evident as the patient positions his or her eyes downward. It is for this reason that this type of deviation most commonly causes difficulty with reading. These patients will often adopt a chin-down compensatory head position in an attempt to attain fusion. &#10;&#10;A- and V-pattern ocular deviations occur as a result of abnormal relative contributions of the oblique and vertical rectus muscles, resulting in an imbalance of their horizontal components in up and down-gaze. For example, in the case of A-pattern deviations, there is either a primary superior oblique overaction, inferior oblique underaction with superior oblique overaction, or inferior rectus underaction, which causes the horizontal exo deviation to become larger in downgaze as compared to upgaze (or the eso deviation to become less apparent in downgaze)."

      "explanation": "While performing the alternate cover test, eye movement will occur in the opposite direction of the deviation. For example, a patient with an eso deviation will manifest outward movement of the eyes (nasal to temporal) as in the above patient. Esophoria is neutralized with base-out prism. When an object is viewed through a prism, its perceived image will become displaced towards the apex of the prism; however, the retinal image will be displaced towards the base of the prism. Therefore, base-out prism will shift the retinal image temporally. In order to place the resultant image onto the fovea, the eye will move in the direction of the apex of the prism. &#10;&#10;Handbook of Pediatric Strabismus and Amblyopia.

      "answers": [" Confusion   "],
      "explanation": "At the onset of strabismus, there are two sensory perceptions that arise based on the normal projection of stimulated retinal points. These are known as confusion and pathological diplopia. In order to appreciate these, the patient must possess the ability to perceive images from both eyes simultaneously. &#10;&#10;Confusion refers to the simultaneous perception of two dissimilar images that are superimposed upon one another. This occurs in cases of strabismus in which the fovea of the fixating eye is stimulated by the image of the target of regard, while the corresponding retinal point in the non-fixating eye (usually the fovea also) is stimulated by the image of a different object. This results in simultaneous superimposition of two different objects. &#10;&#10;Pathological diplopia is the simultaneous appreciation of two images of the same object in two different positions. This occurs in cases of strabismus in which the fovea of the fixating eye is stimulated by the image of a certain object, while that same object falls on a different (non-corresponding) retinal point other than the fovea in the non-fixating eye. This causes the same object to appear in two different locations. In patients with esotropia, the diplopia is considered homonymous (non-crossed), while exotropes experience heteronymous diplopia (crossed)."

Acuities and cover test are unable to be attained as the patient is uncooperative. Hirschberg reveals a light reflex that is displaced nasally by 5 degrees in both eyes and Kappa measures 0 for both the right and left eye. Ocular motilities are normal and the infant does not react when either eye is transiently occluded. Cycloplegic retinoscopy reveals OD: +2.50-1.00 x 180 and OS: +2.25-0.75 x 176.

      "answers": [" Prominent epicanthal folds causing pseudostrabismus   "],
      "explanation": "Because the Hirschberg reflexes are symmetrical and within normal limits and the cycloplegic findings are normal one can assume prominent epicanthal folds are causing the appearance of strabismus. This finding is quite common in patients of Asian origin as well as some Caucasian infants. Because the bridge is slightly flatter and the nasal epicanthal dermis tissue is prominent, the medial canthus can be covered. To confirm this diagnosis, gently pinch the skin of the bridge for gross observation and comparison of the eyes and measure Kappa and Hirschberg. All of these findings should be normal. Be sure to praise the parent for being astute because strabismus is best treated if caught early. If you are in doubt bring the patient back in a month or so and re-measure or refer to a pediatric optometrist or ophthalmologist. &#10;&#10;Reference: Wright, K., Spiegel, P. and Thompson, L.

For example, in the case of left superior oblique weakness, the left eye will be elevated relative to the right eye. Patients will then develop a head tilt toward the right side (or towards the hypotropic eye).

The position of the corneal reflexes relative to the center of the pupil is assessed in each eye. Superior displacement of the corneal reflex suggests hypotropia, while inferior displacement infers hypertropia. Each millimeter of displacement of the reflex from the center of the pupil equates to roughly 22 prism diopters of deviation."

      "explanation": "A strabismus is present with this patient but does not require surgery or correction at this time because the patient does not have a monocular strabismus and the magnitude of the angle of deviation is <20 prism diopters. Additionally, the patient's visual acuity is 20/20 without correction, so no spectacle correction is required at this time. If the patient had a prescription of -0.50 with decreased acuities, one would consider prescribing spectacles. Gross convergence exercises are recommended for improvement in gross convergence activities and control."

In cases of hypermetropia, young children presenting with up to 4D of hyperopia, good acuities, and no complaints, spectacle correction is not necessary. With degrees of hyperopia greater than 4D, or complaints of near vision, a general rule of thumb is to prescribe about 2/3 of the full cycloplegic refraction. In patients where an esotropia exists (as in the patient in this question), the full cycloplegic refraction should always be prescribed (if hyperopic), as this may help reduce the angle of the deviation by decreasing the amount of accommodation that must be employed."

      "explanation": "A contact lens with part-time patching of the left eye would be the best treatment option for this patient. The high anisometropia between the two eyes secondary to the cataract removal and ensuing aphakia would benefit most with a contact lens versus a spectacle correction. Using a contact lens will minimize the image size difference between the two eyes. With such a high prescription, it is important to account for vertex distance to ensure optimal correction. Fc= Fs/1-dFs where Fc= the dioptric power at the corneal plane, Fs= the dioptric power at the spectacle plane, and d is the vertex distance in meters. In general, the vertex distance of the phoropter from the corneal plane is 13 mm unless otherwise specified. Solving for Fc: Fc= +18.00/1-(0.013)(+18.00), Fc = +18.00/1-(0.234), Fc= +18.00/0.766, Fc= +23.49, rounding to the nearest 0.25 is +23.50. &#10;&#10;Patching is an important treatment with this patient, as he is still young. Optimal age for improvement from patching is between the ages of 2-7 for amblyopia. One must patch the good eye, to stimulate the eye with the worse visual acuity. Near activities such as video games, reading, coloring, homework or the computer are recommended in order to stimulate accommodation in the weaker eye. Although ATS studies cite that part-time patching is just as effective, full-time patching is recommended to increase compliance. &#10;&#10;Answer: Spectacle correction OD: +18.00DS OS: +0.75; Patching of the OS 6hrs/day 7days/wk. This is not the optimal treatment, as image size difference between the eyes is too great. Additionally, lens thickness in a spectacle prescription would hinder optimal vision. &#10;&#10;Answer: OD: +18.00 DS Contact Lens OS: no correction; Patching of OD 6hrs/day 7 days/wk. One should recommend patching of the OS not the OD, as the OD has amblyopia, not the OS. &#10;&#10;Answer: OD: +9.00DS Contact Lens; Patching of the OS 6hrs/day 7days/wk. One should prescribe full plus to optimize visual acuity especially since the patient presents with an intermittent esotropia. &#10;&#10;Answer: OD: +18.00 DS OS: plano Spectacle prescription; Patching of the OD 6 hrs/day 7days/wk. A spectacle prescription has too much of an image size difference between the eyes. Additionally, one should patch the OS and not the OD, as the OD is the eye with amblyopia."

      "explanation": "Eccentric fixation refers to an anomalous condition in which some retinal point other than the fovea is used for fixation. Eccentric fixation can occur under both binocular and monocular conditions, but it is best diagnosed with the normally fixating eye occluded. When present, eccentric fixation is observed in the strabismic or amblyopic eye. In a patient with esotropia, the abnormal fixation point is typically located in the nasal retina; with exotropia, the fixation point is located in the temporal retina. Additionally, there can also be a vertical component to eccentric fixation. &#10;&#10;There are several different tests that can be utilized to aid in the diagnosis of eccentric fixation, including the Haidinger's brush test. During this test, the normally fixating eye is occluded while the patient views a blank surface through a rotating polarizer. The patient will then see a small rotating figure eight or bow-tie pattern that represents where the fovea projects in object space. The patient is asked to fixate on a reference dot on the display pattern and report where the brush pattern is located with respect to this point. If the patient states that the brush is placed nasal to the fixation point (as in the above question), this indicates that he or she is using an eccentric fixation point that is nasal to the fovea; the opposite is true if the patient states that the brush is rotating temporal to the reference point. &#10;&#10;Anomalous retinal correspondence is a binocular condition in which there is an abnormal sensory adaptation that results in the fovea of the normal eye being paired with a non-foveal retinal point of the deviating eye. &#10;&#10;Fixation disparity is also a binocular condition in which there is a very small misalignment of the eyes that does not result in a breakdown of single binocular vision. &#10;&#10;Primary Care Optometry (5th edition).

In some cases, patients with strabismus can undergo a sensory adaptation in order to be able to fuse images from each eye. This subtle binocular anomaly is known as anomalous retinal correspondence and has shown to be present in up to half of strabismus cases. In normal retinal correspondence, the two foveae are corresponding retinal points, both having the same occulocentric visual direction. In patients with anomalous retinal correspondence, the fovea of the non-deviating (or better-seeing eye) is matched with another a non-foveal point of the retina of the deviating eye. This occurs only during binocular fixation and reflects a reorganization of the visual direction in the strabismic eye in order to allow for binocular fusion. &#10;&#10;There are several different types of anomalous retinal correspondence based on the measurements of three different angles: the objective angle of strabismus, the subjective angle of strabismus, and the angle of anomaly. &#10;&#10;° Harmonious anomalous retinal correspondence &#10;- Sensory adaptation completely compensates for the angle of strabismus; therefore, there is no subjective angle of strabismus &#10;- The objective angle of strabismus is equal to the angle of anomaly &#10;&#10;° Unharmonious anomalous retinal correspondence &#10;- Usually, the subjective angle of strabismus is smaller than the objective angle of strabismus &#10;- Angle of anomaly is location somewhere between the fovea and point zero (retinal projection of straight ahead direction) &#10;&#10;° Paradoxical anomalous retinal correspondence &#10;- Unexpected sensory adaptations that typically occur following strabismus surgery &#10;- Paradoxical Type I: The angle of anomaly is greater than the objective angle of strabismus, and the objective and subjective angles of strabismus are in opposite directions (eso vs. exo) &#10;- Paradoxical Type II: The subjective angle of strabismus is greater than the objective angle of strabismus (but in the same direction) and the angle of anomaly is smaller than the subjective angle of strabismus"

      "explanation": "When attempting to neutralize the patient's deviation using prism, the stacking of prisms oriented in the same manner will result in the underestimation of the deviation. Stacking of prisms that are oriented in different directions is acceptable (i.e. base-out and base-up). When performing the alternate cover test, it is important to use an appropriate accommodative target as well as having the patient wear their habitual spectacles. Failure to control for accommodation may result in improper measurement of the magnitude of the ocular deviation. When performing the cover test at near, it is often recommended to hold the target slightly below the patient's eye level. &#10;&#10;Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus 2nd ed.

Clinically, this phenomenon is artificially created by having a patient look at a diffusely illuminated blank surface through a rotating polarizer. The patient will then see a small rotating bow-tie pattern. This rotating object represents where the fovea projects in object space. It is most commonly accepted that this phenomenon is caused by the birefringence pattern of the radially oriented fibers of Henle's layer around the fovea. Haidinger's brushes are very helpful in the diagnosis of eccentric fixation. &#10;&#10;Primary Care Optometry (5th edition). Grosvenor, T.P. 2007. Butterworth Heinemann Elsevier. St. Louis, MO."

      "explanation": "In this case, poor entering visual acuities were attributed to refractive amblyopia in both eyes. The patient was not wearing his full potential prescription. When deciding on the spectacle prescription, one should keep in mind that the prescription should have full cylinder and no less than half of the hyperopic prescription. For full visual acuity potential, the retinal images should be equal and balanced, hence keeping the +0.50 DS difference between the two eyes. It is important to follow up on these types of prescription changes in case the patient presents with more hyperopia after adapting to his/her new spectacle prescription. Part-time patching is not warranted at this initial visit as his visual acuity may improve drastically by correcting his refractive error alone, and his refractive error is relatively equal in both eyes."

      "explanation": "Placing a patch over the right eye of his current spectacle prescription along with an immediate ER referral is the most appropriate treatment because the Cranial Nerve VI palsy is acute and ischemic. Grinding prism into the glasses would prove useless, as an ischemic cranial nerve palsy is expected to resolve with time with appropriate systemic treatment. Additionally, 30 diopters of prism is too large to grind into a pair of habitual spectacle lenses. Though the deviation of the esotropia is high, surgery is not warranted at this time because it is caused by ischemia and may completely resolve with time. &#10;&#10;The ER is warranted in this case, as a primary care physician consult would be more appropriate if the patient's systemic blood pressure and fasting blood sugar were not extremely high.

      "answers": [" A four-year old with OD: -2.50 DS and OS: -2.25 DS   "],
      "explanation": "A prescription of myopia that is relatively low to moderate and equal between the eyes will not cause a reduction in stereopsis because even without correction, this person will have good near acuities, and the eyes will be in focus at the same distance. &#10;&#10;A person who has constant alternating esotropia will not possess amblyopia because each eye is used to focus an image, just not at the same time. Because the eyes are not used simultaneously, there will be little to no stereopsis. &#10;&#10;Strabismus results in the perception of two images that are not fusible by the brain, causing diplopia. In order to eliminate double vision, the brain will suppress an eye (usually the deviated eye). This suppression leads to amblyopia and poor stereopsis. &#10;&#10;A prescription of OD:-3.25 DS and OS:-0.75 DS will not lead to amblyopia because even though the right eye is blurry in the distance, at 30 cm its image will be clear and in focus. This also applies to the prescription of OD: +1.50 DS and OS: -2.00 DS. Although both patients will have good monocular corrected acuities, they will most likely possess poor stereopsis due to a decreased amount of binocular neurons because the eyes are never in focus at the same distance."

      "explanation": "When hand neutralizing a lens, one must first determine if the lens is spherical or possesses astigmatism. While holding up the lens and looking through it at some type of cross hair grid or vertical line, rotate the lens and observe whether or not the line viewed through the glass appears to 'break' relative to the line that is not viewed through the lenses. If a break is observed, the lens has astigmatism. The location on the lens where the line appears to 'break' in the same direction of the rotation (with break) is the minus cylinder axis. The other principal meridian of the lens is located 90 degrees away and should exhibit 'against break' motion. &#10;&#10;Neutralize each meridian separately and place the answers on an optical cross. It is imperative to change the signs of the powers, as the true power of the unknown lens will be opposite those of the neutralizing lenses. The minus cylinder axis should be the meridian with the least minus power (or most plus power). The power of the lens can then be written in minus cylinder form. The axis can be determined by placing the lens against a protractor, with the temporal and the nasal aspect of the frame aligned with the 180 and zero marks for the left eye, with the temples facing towards you (the 180 should always be located to the left for each eye and gradually decrease to zero while moving to the right). The location on the lens with the meridian that displayed 'with break' will be the minus cylinder axis."

The different clinical types of astigmatism are described below. &#10;&#10;Simple astigmatism: When accommodation is relaxed, one focal line is located at the retina; the other is located either in front of or behind the retina &#10;- If the second focal line is in front of the retina, this is simple myopic astigmatism (one principle meridian is plano, the other is myopic) &#10;- If the second focal line is located behind the retina, this is simple hyperopic astigmatism (one principle meridian is plano, the other is hyperopic) &#10;&#10;Compound astigmatism: When accommodation is relaxed, both focal lines are located either in front of or behind the retina &#10;- If both are located in front of the retina, this is considered compound myopic astigmatism (both principle meridians are myopic) &#10;- If both are located behind the retina, this is classified as compound hyperopic astigmatism (both principle meridians are hyperopic) &#10;&#10;Mixed astigmatism: With relaxed accommodation, one focal line will be located in front of the retina and one line will be located behind the retina (one principle meridian is myopic, the other is hyperopic). &#10;&#10;In order to determine where the focal points are located for a given spectacle correction, place the values on an optical cross. Plus values indicate that the focal line is behind the retina, minus values indicate focal points in front of the retina, and a value of plano indicates a focal line that is located on the retina. &#10;&#10;In the above question, the spectacle prescription of +2.75 -2.75 x 180, when placed on an optical cross, will have one principle meridian that is hyperopic and one that is plano.

      "explanation": "Another formula that you may want to commit to memory is Javal's rule. Javal's rule is used to predict the magnitude of refractive astigmatism based upon keratometry readings. The formula is refractive astigmatism = (1.25 x the difference in keratometry readings) +/- 0.50 D. If the astigmatism is with-the-rule, 0.50 D is subtracted, if the astigmatism is against-the-rule, 0.50 D is added to the results. If the astigmatism is oblique, 0.50 D is dropped from the equation. &#10;&#10;Grosvenor et al (1988) later proposed that dropping the 1.25 factor from the equation results in more accurate calculations and modified the formula to: refractive astigmatism = the difference in keratometry readings +/- 0.50 D (added or subtracted based upon if the astigmatism is with or against-the-rule). Oblique astigmatism simply is thought to be equal to the oblique corneal toricity. &#10;&#10;For our example above, the astigmatism is considered with the rule therefore 1.25 x 1 = 1.25. 1.25-0.5 = 0.75 D."

      "answers": [" 4.00 D against the rule   "],
      "explanation": "Another formula that you may wish to commit to memory is Javal's rule. Javal's rule is used to predict the magnitude of refractive astigmatism based upon keratometry readings. The formula is refractive astigmatism = (1.25 x the difference in keratometry readings) +/- 0.50D. If the astigmatism is with-the-rule, the 0.50 D is subtracted, if the astigmatism is against-the-rule, the 0.50 D is added to the results. If the astigmatism is oblique, 0.50 D is dropped from the equation. &#10;&#10;Grosvenor et al (1988) later proposed that dropping the 1.25 factor from the equation yields more accurate results and modified the formula to: refractive astigmatism = the difference in keratometry readings +/- 0.50 D (again, added or subtracted based upon if the astigmatism is with or against-the-rule). Oblique astigmatism simply is thought to be equal to the oblique corneal toricity. &#10;&#10;For the above example (using Javal's rule), the astigmatism is considered to be against the rule as the flat axis is located at 80 degrees. Therefore 1.25 x (46.00 - 43.25) = 3.44. 0.50 diopters is then added to 3.44, which equals 3.94, and rounding up to the nearest diopter yields 4.00 D. &#10;&#10;Following Javal's rule, if the astigmatism were with the rule, 0.50 would be subtracted from 3.44 to equal 2.94, and rounding up would yield 3.00 D."

Both vectors also have a known length (magnitude) of 2 prism diopters. &#10;&#10;Find the magnitude of the resultant prism using the equation A^2 + B^2 = C^2 &#10;2^2 + 2^2 = C^2 &#10;C = 2.8 prism diopters &#10;In order to find the direction of the prism, use the equation tan (angle) = y/x &#10;tan (angle) = 2/2 &#10;angle = 45 degrees &#10;&#10;Therefore, the resultant prism vector can be described as 2.8 prism diopters @ 45 degrees (from the vantage point of viewing the patient when his glasses are on)."

The primary focal length can be solved via f= -n/D. Solving for f'=1.33/45D, f'= 2.95 cm to the right of the lens (because the answer is positive).

      "question": "Using the Feinbloom chart at a distance of 5 feet, your patient is able to read the number '7' (20/700 at a testing distance of 20 feet) on the first page. What would be the corresponding acuity at 20 feet?",
      "options": [" 20/1000  ", " 20/1600  ", " 20/2800   ", " 20/700  ", " 20/1400  "],
      "answers": [" 20/2800   "],
      "explanation": "The Feinbloom chart is useful for low vision patients and offers good portability. Although the chart is calibrated for a 20-foot distance, it can be used at any distance as long as the resulting acuity is altered accordingly. At a distance of 20 feet the initial optotype is 20/700; therefore, if the testing distance is moved to 5 feet (the clinician would record 5/700), the numerator and the denominator should be multiplied by four as the testing distance is four times closer. A benefit of using the Feinbloom chart is that it offers a good range in visual acuity along with high contrast optotypes. Drawbacks of this chart include only one optotype for several acuity ranges along with non-standard numbers, rendering it difficult to correlate the acuity measurement of this chart with that of others."

Therefore solve for x. (8.73mm)(x)=13 yields 13/8.73 =x, giving us x=1.5, therefore the optotype is 1.5 times bigger than the 20/20 optotype.

      "explanation": "Since the Snellen system of visual acuity notation is linear and based on visual angles subtended at the eye, equivalent visual acuities with different letter sizes and viewing distances can be determined with the use of ratios. In this case, the equivalent visual acuity at 20 feet for the given acuity of 20/80 at 32 feet (32/80) is determined by the ratios of 32/80 = 20/X. Thus solving for the value of X = 20*80/32 or 50.

In an astigmatic eye, the line foci formed by the principal meridians of the eye are perpendicular to their respective meridians. For example, the line focus that corresponds to the 120-degree meridian of the eye is parallel to the 30-degree meridian. The lines on a clock dial that are parallel to the line foci closest to the retina will appear clearer and darker than the other lines. In this case, the line focus corresponding to the emmetropic meridian of the eye is closest to the retina and therefore would appear as the clearest and darkest. This meridian is 150 degrees; its line focus is parallel to 60 degrees. The lines on the clock dial that are parallel to the 60-degree meridian are the 5-11 o'clock lines."

However, this question is asking us to work backwards and determine the gross findings from the net results. The first step is to calculate the reciprocal of the working distance 1/0.67= 1.50 D.

The clinician focuses the light beam on the child's pupil and performs retinoscopy in the usual manner. The clinician should closely monitor the size of the pupil, as fluctuations likely indicate changes in accommodation. Traditionally, -1.25 D is added to the gross retinoscopy findings. Some authors have stated that the results are more accurate if -0.75 D is added to the gross retinoscopy findings of children 0-2 years of age and if -1.00 D is added to the gross retinoscopy findings of children older than 2 years of age."

      "question": "If using the clock dial to determine the axis of astigmatism, what is the numerical value of the degree to which the axis of the principal meridians can be refined?",
      "options": [" 30 degrees  ", " 5 degrees  ", " 7.5 degrees   ", " 15 degrees  "],
      "answers": [" 7.5 degrees   "],
      "explanation": "The clock dial is a type of astigmatic dial that can be used for cylindrical refraction. Each clock hour represents 30 degrees. The axis of astigmatism can be found by asking the patient which clock hour appears the blackest/sharpest. One must then multiply the smallest number of the clearest clock position by 30 degrees. For instance, if the patient reports that the 2-8 line appears blackest and sharpest, the axis of astigmatism would be 60 degrees (2 x 30= 60 degrees). In this way, one can refine the axis of astigmatism up to 7.5 degrees. If the patient reports that the 1-7 and the 2-8 lines are equally clear, the axis would lie in between the two; therefore, 1 x 30= 30 degrees. Midway between the 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock position is 30 degrees divided by 2; thus, 30/2= 15 degrees. We must now add 15 degrees to our previous number of 30 degrees because the astigmatism axis lies in between the 1 and 2 o'clock positions; this gives us a total of 45 degrees. If the patient reported that the 2-8 line was clearest, followed by the 1-7 line, which is then noted as being clearer than the 3-9 line, one could infer that the axis lies one quarter between the 2-8 line and the 1-7 line, with the axis laying closer to the 2-8 line, since this clock hour appears the clearest. The axis would be determined as follows: 2 x 30= 60. 30/4= 7.5 degrees (because the axis lies one-quarter the way between the 2-8 and 1-7 lines). 60-7.5= 52.5 degrees."

      "explanation": "The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. From shorter to longer wavelengths, the spectrum begins with gamma rays, X-rays, ultra-violet, visible, infra-red, microwaves, radio waves. Visible light is limited to a very small part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which ranges from 400 nanometers to 700 nanometers. Another way to represent this is 400 x10-9 to 700 x10-9; therefore, 1 nanometer is equal to 10-9 meters."

      "answers": [" 60 diopters, cornea   "],
      "explanation": "The total convergence power of the adult human eye is approximately 60 diopters. The cornea and tear film contribute approximately 43 diopters of power (about 2/3 of the total refractive power), while the crystalline lens provides roughly 20 diopters of power (about 1/3 of the overall refractive power). If the lens were removed from the eye, it would technically be considered a more powerful optic system by itself; however, because of the smaller difference in the refractive indices between the aqueous and lens as compared to the air and cornea, less convergence exists at the refractive surface of the crystalline lens. It is also important to note that due to the distance between the cornea and the lens (anterior chamber depth), the refractive powers of each component cannot simply be added together."

The formula to determine the deviation (d) is d=360 degrees-2(theta) where theta= the angle between the two mirrors. For the above example, 280= 360-2(theta) solving for theta gives 360-280=2(theta) yields 80=2(theta), which results in 40 degrees."

This method is based on the fact that a target (in our case a black line) that lies parallel to a line focus that is closest to the retina of an eye with astigmatism will appear to be clearer than a line that lies perpendicular to it. This technique is based upon the fact that the black line of the astigmatic dial that is closest to the least ametropic meridian of an astigmatic eye will appear clearest. The fan dial line that is the least in-focus will be located 90 degrees away from this location. &#10;In order for the astigmatic dial to work properly accommodation must be controlled otherwise the astigmatic interval will shift either forwards or back causing the perception of the clearest line to be altered. Accommodation can be controlled either by fogging (the addition of plus lenses in the phoropter) or, as a last resort, cycloplegia."

      "answers": [" Add +0.25 D to the right eye   "],
      "explanation": "When performing a binocular balance test via prism dissociation the goal is for the patient to report equal clarity between the two images while fogged by +0.50 OU. One caveat is that the patient must have equal acuities (i.e. the absence of amblyopia, asymmetrical cataracts etc.) It does not really matter which eye receives base up and which eye receives base down. In this case 4 base up over the right eye will correspond to the lower image and 4 base down over the left eye will correspond to the upper image (remember the image is projected towards the apex of the prism). You always add plus lenses to the clearer image to ensure that the patient is not over-minussed. Therefore, in the above example, +0.25 D should be added to the right eye until the patient reports that the images are equally clear. If a reversal occurs (the fellow eye becomes clearer) the +0.25 D should be removed from the right eye (this pertains only for reversal)."

      "explanation": "The bichrome test is useful when acuities are unequal between the eyes or it can be used as a general balance test when acuities are equal. This test is performed by occluding one eye and projecting letters on a red and green background. The patient is initially fogged about +0.50 D. Fogging generally over-plusses the patients such that they report that the letters are blacker and bolder on the red side of the chart meaning that there is a need to add minus lenses or reduce plus power. The red should appear blacker/bolder with overplussing because this shifts the chromatic interval forward causing objects projected on a background with longer wavelengths (red) to be bolder. The addition of minus lenses should equate the two sides so that the letters appear equally black and bold. If the patient reports that the letters on the green are bolder initially then either plus lenses need to be added or minus powered lenses need to be reduced to shift the chromatic interval forwards. Erroneous responses may occur with a person who is suffering from cataracts or a red-green color defect."

The addition of minus powered lenses will result in a greater with motion reflex. Occluding the left eye during this test may cause erroneous results due to the fact that accommodation will no longer be controlled. Occlusion may result in fluctuations of the reflex as the patient may look around to avoid the light from the retinoscope."

      "question": "After completing a subjective refraction on your patient, you obtain the following best-corrected visual acuities: OD: 20/20, OS: 20/50. You wish to perform a balance test. Which of the following balance tests is the MOST appropriate to perform?",
      "options": [" Alternating occlusion  ", " Red/green balance test (bichrome)   ", " Prism dissociation balance test  ", " Cover testing  "],
      "answers": [" Red/green balance test (bichrome)   "],
      "explanation": "The bichrome test is useful when acuities are unequal between the eyes; it can also be used as a general balance test when acuities are equal. This test is performed by occluding one eye and projecting letters on a red and green background. The patient is initially fogged about + 0.50 D. Fogging generally over-plusses the patients such that they report that the letters are blacker and bolder on the red side of the chart, meaning that there is a need to add minus lenses or reduce plus power. The red should appear blacker/bolder with over-plussing because this shifts the chromatic interval forward, causing objects projected on a background with longer wavelengths (red) to be bolder. The addition of minus lenses should equate the two sides such that the letters appear equally black and bold. If the patient initially reports that the letters on the green side are bolder, then either plus lenses need to be added or minus lenses need to be reduced to shift the chromatic interval forward. Erroneous responses may occur with a patient suffering from cataracts or a red-green color defect. &#10;&#10;Prism dissociation and alternating occlusion both require equal acuities between the eyes and therefore are of little value for this particular patient. Cover testing is not considered a binocular balance test."

      "explanation": "The clock dial is an example of a fixed astigmatism dial. The target is not mobile. Whereas the rotary-T dial, the arrowhead dial and the Raubitschek (paraboline) dial are all rotary. The rotary dials contain fewer lines than the clock dial. These targets are rotated to locate the principal meridians. During rotation of the target, when the patient reports that one of the lines is the clearest and blackest and that the line perpendicular to it is least clear, the endpoint has been reached. At this point cylinder power is added to neutralize the astigmatism."

      "answers": [" Compound myopic astigmatism   "],
      "explanation": "Refractive astigmatism is classified by the relationship of the two focal lines that are produced by the refractive components of the eye with respect to the retina (when accommodation is relaxed). The different clinical types of astigmatism are described below. &#10;&#10;Simple astigmatism: When accommodation is relaxed, one focal line is located at the retina, while the other is located either in front of or behind the retina &#10;- If the second focal line is in front of the retina, this is simple myopic astigmatism (one principle meridian is plano, the other is myopic) &#10;- If the second focal line is behind the retina, this is simple hyperopic astigmatism (one principle meridian is plano, the other is hyperopic) &#10;&#10;Compound astigmatism: When accommodation is relaxed, both focal lines are located either in front of or behind the retina &#10;- If both are located in front of the retina; this is considered compound myopic astigmatism (both principle meridians are myopic) &#10;- If both are located behind the retina; this is classified as compound hyperopic astigmatism (both principle meridians are hyperopic) &#10;&#10;Mixed astigmatism: &#10;- With relaxed accommodation, one focal line will be located in front of the retina and one line will be located behind the retina (one principle meridian is myopic, the other is hyperopic) &#10;&#10;In order to determine where the focal points are located for a given spectacle correction, place the values on an optical cross. Plus values indicate that the focal line is behind the retina, minus values indicate focal points in front of the retina, and a value of plano indicates a focal line located on the retina. &#10;&#10;In the above question, the spectacle prescription of -3.00 +2.25 x 160 will have myopic principle meridians (-3.00 and -0.75) when placed on an optical cross.

      "options": [" Curvature of field  ", " Coma  ", " Chromatic aberration   ", " Spherical aberration  ", " Radial astigmatism  "],
      "answers": [" Chromatic aberration   "],
      "explanation": "Chromatic aberration is a type of distortion in which a lens is unable to focus all wavelengths of light to the same convergence point. It occurs due to the fact that the refractive index of any medium (other than a vacuum) varies with wavelength. Therefore, shorter wavelengths (blues) will bend more as they pass through a lens, while longer wavelengths (reds) bend less. This leads to a variation in the image location (longitudinal chromatic aberration) and image size (lateral chromatic aberration). &#10;&#10;In a subjective refraction, it is ideal to have the retina centered between the image point for the shorter and longer wavelengths. The use of the Red-Green test allows this to occur. If a patient reports that the letters on the red side are clearer, this indicates that the center point is too far in front of the retina, and a minus lens will improve this balance (Red Add Minus-RAM). If the patient reports that the green side is sharper, the center point is too far behind the retina, and a plus lens will shift the balance (Green Add Plus-GAP). This entire test is dependent on the principles of chromatic aberrations."

      "question": "You are comparing the optical properties of the +20D lens in your trial lens kit to your +20D binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy (BIO) lens. You notice that when you hold each lens 5cm above a grid drawn on a paper, there is deformity in the periphery of the image formed by the trial lens that is much less apparent in the image formed by your BIO lens. Which of the following types of aberration accounts for this noticeable difference?",
      "options": [" Curvature of field  ", " Radial astigmatism  ", " Spherical aberration   ", " Chromatic aberration  ", " Coma  "],
      "answers": [" Spherical aberration   "],
      "explanation": "Spherical aberration occurs when parallel light rays that are incident on an optical refracting element towards the edge of the lens are bent more than those light rays that travel through the system closer to the center of the lens. As the power of the lens increases, greater distortion is produced by this type of aberration. The effects of spherical aberration on image quality can be demonstrated by viewing a grid printed on a piece of paper with a standard +20D trial lens and a +20D lens that is used for BIO. Both lenses will create a focused image when held 5cm from the paper; however, when analyzing the quality of the image, one will be able to observe a fair amount of distortion in the periphery of the image created by the +20D trial lens which is not present with the BIO lens. This difference is due to spherical aberrations that occur due to the unequal bending of peripheral light rays with the trial lens. BIO lenses are aspheric (the lens flattens in the periphery to reduce the focusing power of light rays entering the optical system closer to the lens edge), thus reducing the overall spherical aberration produced by the refracting element."

High myopia will decrease the field of view experienced by the examiner while, high levels of hyperopia will increase the field of view. The magnification while viewing through a DO is roughly 15x for an emmetrope, as is illustrated by the following formula: M=D(eye)/4 where M = magnification, D(eye) = the dioptric power of the eye. 60/4=15x.

      "options": [" Depth of focus   ", " Accommodation  ", " Depth of field  ", " Field of view  "],
      "answers": [" Depth of focus   "],
      "explanation": "Pinholes only allow a very narrow central beam of light to enter the eye, preventing the outermost rays in the pencil of light from reaching the retina. It is these outermost rays that create a larger blur circle at the retina in cases of hyperopia, myopia, and astigmatic refractive errors. By blocking these improperly bent peripheral light rays and only letting the light rays that pass through the central portion of the pupil, the refractive error of the ocular system is not noticed as much because of the reduction in the size of the circle of confusion and the increase in depth of focus. This improvement in visual acuity can be remarkable. &#10;&#10;Depth of focus is the range of distance in image space for which an object appears to be in focus. In the case of a camera, it is the film plane; in the case of the human eye, it is the tolerance of placement of the image in relation to the retina. When measuring visual acuity with a pinhole, the object placement does not change; however, the image placement with respect to the retina does; therefore, this is known as depth of focus. &#10;&#10;Depth of field is often confused with depth of focus. Depth of field is the range of distances in object space for which object points appear to be in focus for a fixed position of the image plane (without accommodation)."

Consequently, the brightness of the retinal image depends only on the pupil diameter; this is also known as the aperture stop. On the other hand, the diameter of the magnifying lens is directly proportional to the field of view (field stop)."

      "answers": [" Hyperacuity (Vernier)   "],
      "explanation": "Vernier acuity is also known as hyperacuity. This type of acuity deals with differences in alignment and direction. Humans have excellent vernier acuity (threshold of roughly 3 seconds of arc), which is very minimally affected by defocus. Resolution acuity deals with the ability to discern a figure or pattern from a background. Snellen visual acuity is a type of resolution acuity. As optometrists, we provide the patient with the best possible resolution acuity through the use of optical aids and devices; therefore, this type of acuity is largely dependent upon optimal viewing conditions. The human threshold for resolution acuity is approximately 30 seconds of arc. Recognition is the ability to recognize a target such as a letter or number. However, in order for recognition to occur, one must first be able to resolve the target. This type of acuity is also affected by defocus. Stereoacuity is a product of binocular retinal disparity. Measurement of this acuity requires optimal visual correction and is therefore influenced by defocus."

      "options": [" Hyperopia  ", " Presbyopia  ", " Large amounts of astigmatism  ", " Myopia   "],
      "answers": [" Myopia   "],
      "explanation": "Although there has been much debate in the past over whether or not the etiology of refractive errors was environmental versus inherited, it is now believed that both factors contribute to the development of ametropias. Hung et al, 1995 demonstrated that by placing a prescription lens over one eye of an infant monkey and removing it after the eye had reached maturity, the mature eye developed the refractive error that the lens is normally meant to neutralize. A minus lens induced myopia and a plus lens induced hyperopia. Regardless of whether the etiology of the refractive error is inherited or environmental, it is absolutely essential that a clear retinal image be present in order for emmetropization to occur."

      "explanation": "The critical angle is the angle at which light is bent at the interface of two media of different indexes that results in total internal reflection because the light becomes refracted by 90 degrees. This can only occur when light travels from a medium with a higher index of refraction to a medium with a lower index of refraction. The critical angle can be determined using the formula ic= inverse sin (n'/n) where n'= the index of the second medium and n= the index of the first medium encountered by light. For the above example, ic= inverse sin (1.0/1.33), ic=48.75 degrees."

      "explanation": "The critical angle (ic) for a light traveling from a medium of higher index to lower index is that angle of incidence such that the predicted angle of refraction is 90 degrees. Any angle greater than or equal to the critical angle will cause the incident light to be 100% reflected. This is also known as total internal reflection. &#10;&#10;In this example, use Snell's law equation with i' equaling 90 degrees. &#10;n sin ic = n' sin 90 &#10;1.52 sin ic = 1.0 sin 90 &#10;The equation for critical angle can also be written as ic = sin-1 (n'/n) &#10;ic= sin-1 (1.0/1.52)"

      "options": [
        " Increase the overhead illumination  ",
        " Tilt yourself away from the patient and perform retinoscopy off-axis  ",

        " Move the sleeve of the retinoscope halfway up the sleeve interval   "
      ],
      "answers": [" Move the sleeve of the retinoscope halfway up the sleeve interval   "],
      "explanation": "Enhancing the reflex can be achieved by moving the sleeve of the retinoscope upwards. Changing the position of the sleeve will narrow the beam; this can aid in visualization of the reflex. When the sleeve is pushed down as far as the instrument will allow, the emerging light from the retinoscope is divergent, as the mirror is in a plano position. Moving the sleeve all the way to the top causes emerging light to be convergent because the mirror of the retinoscope is in a concave position. In order to enhance the reflex when neutralizing a moderate or high astigmatism, moving the sleeve up so that it rests between the plano mirror and concave mirror position will result in a narrow and brighter reflex, allowing for easier alignment. This technique does not work well in patients with mild amounts of astigmatism. &#10;&#10;Performing retinoscopy off-axis will not yield accurate results and may result in induced astigmatism. It is important to control for accommodation during retinoscopy; therefore, occluding the other eye is not recommended."

      "answers": [" Increased by +0.50 D  "],
      "explanation": "The spherical component should be increased by +0.50 D. For every 0.50 D change in astigmatism, the spherical component should be altered by 0.25 D in the opposite direction. Therefore, if the astigmatism is increased by -0.50 D then +0.25 D should be added to the spherical component. This ensures that the circle of least confusion remains on the retina."

      "explanation": "Auto-refraction is a relatively simple and efficient means of refraction that, in general, appears to have fairly decent reliability (although it is still not quite as good as the gold standard of conventional refraction). The sphere power ranges from -20.00D to +23.00D and the cylinder correction ranges from -0.25 to 12.00 D. The system does control for accommodation by utilizing fogging. &#10;&#10;Some drawbacks to the system include: requires a minimum pupil diameter of at least 2.5 to 2.9 mm, does not work well on people with either ocular media opacities (i.e cataracts) corneal irregularities or accommodative anomalies such as accommodative spasm."

The third Purkinje image is the largest and is produced by reflection off of the anterior plane of the crystalline lens; Purkinje image III is also virtual and erect. The fourth Purkinje image is the smallest and is real and inverted. Purkinje image IV is formed by the reflection off of the posterior surface of the lens.

      "answers": [" With-motion   "],
      "explanation": "With-motion (accounting for working distance) results when the far point of the eye is positioned behind the patient's retina and therefore is characteristic of hyperopia. The addition of plus-powered lenses will bring the far point of the eye forward so that it is conjugate with the aperture of the retinoscope. &#10;&#10;Against-motion is observed when the far point of the patient's eye is located between the retinoscope and the patient's eye. Light rays reflected from the retina of a myopic eye will emerge convergently because the far point of the eye is in front of the cornea. For a myope, the far point will be located in front of the retina but at a finite distance (that is, it will not be located at optical infinity). The addition of minus-powered lenses will help to push back the far point of the eye so that it is conjugate with the aperture of the retinoscope. &#10;&#10;Neutral motion (accounting for working distance) occurs when the far point of the eye is located at the viewing aperture of the retinoscope and indicates emmetropia."

      "explanation": "According to ANSI standards regarding error tolerances for spectacle lenses, the above prescription is considered to fall outside of standards due to the difference in the cylinder axis of the measured and ordered lens prescriptions. &#10;The ANSI standard for tolerance in cylinder axis of prescriptions with a cylinder power of 1.75 diopters or greater is 2 degrees in any direction. The above prescription was ordered with an axis of 042; however, it was verified to be 045. Because the cylinder power is greater than 1.75 diopters, this axis difference of 3 degrees does not meet ANSI standards. &#10;When determining the error tolerances for the sphere power of spectacle lenses, one must first find the meridian of the highest absolute power. In this question (when placed on an optical cross), the meridian of highest absolute power is axis 135 in which the power should be -15.50 D. This should then be compared to the prescription that was sent from the lab, which is -15.25 (at axis 132). The difference between these two powers is 0.25. ANSI standards read that for sphere powers above 6.50 D, the tolerance is +/- 2% of the power. Therefore, this prescription falls within ANSI standards because the difference is 0.25 and 0.31 is allowed (2% of 15.50 is 0.31). &#10;ANSI standards for error tolerance in cylinder power is +/- 0.15 D for cylinder powers of 2.25 to 4.50 D (the above prescription meets ANSI standards as there is no difference between what was ordered and what was measured for cylinder power).&#10;PowerPage&#10;ANSI Standards"

      "explanation": "Research has demonstrated that, if performed correctly, Mohindra retinoscopy may yield accurate results that are similar to retinoscopy with cycloplegia. Therefore, when there is a contraindication for the use of cycloplegic drops or in the event that a parent is resistant to the use of pharmaceuticals, this technique may yield results that are similar to wet retinoscopy values. However, Mohindra retinoscopy assumes that tonic accommodation contributes 0.75D when, in actuality, tonic accommodation may measure between 0 to 4D. With the Mohindra method of retinoscopy, some patients may be under-plussed. In the event of poor patient attention, high refractive error or fluctuating responses, a cycloplegic refraction may be warranted. &#10;&#10;Off-axis retinoscopy or dissociating the eyes with prism does not yield accurate results.

      "explanation": "A working distance of 50 cm creates a divergent wave of 2.00 D that is neutralized by retinoscopy in addition to the patient's refractive error. Therefore, 2.00 D must be subtracted from the spherical portion of the findings. To determine how much to subtract from the gross findings, one must first calculate the reciprocal of the working distance in meters. In our case, 1/0.5 = 2. Therefore +1.50 (the spherical gross findings) -2.00 = -0.50 -1.50 x 090. Remember NET is the final result, this is found after the working distance has been accounted for by subtracting the working distance from the spherical portion of the findings."

The different clinical types of astigmatism are described below. &#10;&#10;Simple astigmatism: When accommodation is relaxed, one focal line is located at the retina; the other is located either in front of or behind the retina &#10;- If the second focal line is in front of the retina, this is simple myopic astigmatism (one principle meridian is plano, the other is myopic) &#10;- If the second focal line is located behind the retina, this is simple hyperopic astigmatism (one principle meridian is plano, the other is hyperopic) &#10;&#10;Compound astigmatism: When accommodation is relaxed, both focal lines are located either in front of or behind the retina &#10;- If both are located in front of the retina, this is considered compound myopic astigmatism (both principle meridians are myopic) &#10;- If both are located behind the retina, this is classified as compound hyperopic astigmatism (both principle meridians are hyperopic) &#10;&#10;Mixed astigmatism: With relaxed accommodation, one focal line will be located in front of the retina and one line will be located behind the retina (one principle meridian is myopic, the other is hyperopic). &#10;&#10;In order to determine where the focal points are located for a given spectacle correction, place the values on an optical cross. Plus values indicate that the focal line is behind the retina, minus values indicate focal points in front of the retina, and a value of plano indicates a focal line that is located on the retina. &#10;&#10;In the above question, the spectacle prescription of +2.00 -0.50 x 120 will have hyperopic principle meridians (+2.00 and +1.50) when placed on an optical cross.

A large pupil results in increased spherical aberration, which may also lead to confusing retinoscopy findings, as the center of the pupil may display with-motion while the peripheral portion of the pupil may exhibit against-motion. In the case of a large pupil, it is important to focus on the reflex at the center of the pupil to increase the accuracy of your results. The range of neutrality may also be increased in patients with larger pupils due to the creation of anomalous with-motion due to spherical aberration. &#10;&#10;Optom Vis Sci. 2004 Sep;81(9):663-72."

      "options": [" Radial astigmatism  ", " Curvature of field  ", " Coma  ", " Chromatic aberration   ", " Spherical aberration  "],
      "answers": [" Chromatic aberration   "],
      "explanation": "Chromatic aberration is a type of distortion in which a lens is unable to focus all wavelengths of light to the same convergence point. It occurs because the refractive index of any medium (other than a vacuum) varies with wavelength. Therefore, shorter wavelengths (blues) will bend more as they pass through a lens, while longer wavelengths (reds) bend less. This leads to a variation in the image location (longitudinal chromatic aberration) and image size (lateral chromatic aberration). &#10;&#10;A rainbow is produced by billions of tiny droplets of water vapor hovering in the air either during or after rain. Each water droplet acts as a very small yet powerful round refracting lens. As described above, these 'lenses' will bend each wavelength of light differently as a result of chromatic aberration. Billions of these water droplets refracting light in this manner will create the appearance of a rainbow."

      "answers": [" Refraction  "],
      "explanation": "In general, upon entering a material of which the index is different than the material the light ray is exiting, the ray will change its direction. This is called refraction. Refraction occurs because of the speed change that light undergoes when it changes mediums. &#10;&#10;The angle of refraction is the angle that a refracted light ray makes with the normal to an interface separating different media. Keep in mind that when a ray is directed along the normal, it will pass straight through the medium undeviated (it will slow down but will not bend). If the light travels from a lower to higher index, the ray will bend towards the normal, and away from the normal if traveling from higher to lower index. &#10;&#10;The law of refraction states that the incident, normal, and refracted rays all lie in the same plane. The angles of refraction are related by Snell's law (n sin i = n' sin i'). Snell's law does not distinguish between incident and refracted rays; therefore, the path is reversible (it doesn't matter which direction light is coming from)."

      "explanation": "After retinoscopy is performed, the left eye should be occluded to allow for prescription refinement via subjective refraction. The first step is to fog and then unfog the right eye in 0.25 D steps to achieve the spherical lens that affords the best visual acuity. The Jackson crossed-cylinder is then placed before the eye, commencing with cylinder axis refinement. The majority of clinicians agree that if 0.75 D or more of astigmatism is present, the clinician should begin with cylinder axis refinement proceeded by cylinder power refinement. It is important to verify cylinder axis prior to cylinder power because an off-axis refraction can lead to erroneous results. Once the axis of the astigmatism is determined, the clinician should then confirm the amount of cylinder power."

      "explanation": "According to Knapp's law, anisometropia caused by unequal axial lengths is best corrected by glasses, whereas anisometropia caused by dissimilar corneal curvatures is best corrected by contact lenses. Knapp suggested that if anisometropia induced by dissimilar corneal curvatures were to be corrected by glasses, the resulting aniseikonia would be difficult for the patient to handle, as they would be unable to fuse the images due to size difference. However, this law fails to consider other important factors, such as cortical processing and stretching of the retina, among others."

      "question": "A concerned mother wants to know if her 10-year-old child has amblyopia. Her uncorrected visual acuities are 20/40 OU. Her ocular health assessment is unremarkable, as is the unilateral cover test. You decide to pinhole the child and she reads 20/20 OD, OS. What can you conclude from this finding?",

        " The decreased visual acuity is attributable to strabismic amblyopia  "
      ],
      "answers": [" The decreased acuity is likely due to a refractive error   "],
      "explanation": "If a patient is capable of seeing 20/20 with a pinhole, then decreased acuity attributable to an uncorrected refractive error must be ruled out. Amblyopia will not improve with a pinhole. Anisometropic amblyopia may develop in eyes that have as little as a 1.00 D refractive error difference. Typically, the greater the difference in refractive errors between the eyes, the greater the degree of amblyopia. Strabismic amblyopia occurs in the presence of a constant unilateral eye turn that is present before the critical period (prior to ages 6-8). Deprivation amblyopia is caused by an actual physical barrier that impedes clear vision, such as a cataract or a complete ptosis that is present prior to the critical period."

      "answers": [" Mixed astigmatism   "],
      "explanation": "Refractive astigmatism is classified by the relationship of the two focal lines that are produced by the refractive components of the eye with respect to the retina (when accommodation is relaxed). The different clinical types of astigmatism are described below. &#10;&#10;Simple astigmatism: When accommodation is relaxed, one focal line is located at the retina; the other is located either in front of or behind the retina &#10;- If the second focal line is in front of the retina, this is simple myopic astigmatism (one principle meridian is plano, the other is myopic) &#10;- If the second focal line is located behind the retina, this is simple hyperopic astigmatism (one principle meridian is plano, the other is hyperopic) &#10;&#10;Compound astigmatism: When accommodation is relaxed, both focal lines are located either in front of or behind the retina &#10;- If both are located in front of the retina, this is considered compound myopic astigmatism (both principle meridians are myopic) &#10;- If both are located behind the retina, this is classified as compound hyperopic astigmatism (both principle meridians are hyperopic) &#10;&#10;Mixed astigmatism: With relaxed accommodation, one focal line will be located in front of the retina and one line will be located behind the retina (one principle meridian is myopic, the other is hyperopic). &#10;&#10;In order to determine where the focal points are located for a given spectacle correction, place the values on an optical cross. Plus values indicate that the focal line is behind the retina, minus values indicate focal points in front of the retina, and a value of plano indicates a focal line that is located on the retina. &#10;&#10;In the above question, the spectacle prescription of +2.75 -3.50 x 110, when placed on an optical cross, will have one principle meridian that is hyperopic (+2.75) and one that is myopic (-0.75).

      "answers": [" Coma aberration   "],
      "explanation": "Coma is a type of aberration that occurs when an off-axis point source of light (object) is imaged. The rays that pass through the outer margins of the lens focus at different distances from the optical axis as compared to rays that pass through the center of the lens. This results in a series of ring-shaped images (known as comatic circles) from bundles of parallel rays that pass through the lens at equal distances from the axis. Each comatic circle produced by the optical system is of different magnification and distance from the optical axis, and when combined, results in a V-shaped or comet-like flare."

      "question": "If a real object located at optical infinity results in the formation of an image that is focused on the retinal surface of an emmetropic, reduced eye (n=1.33, radius of curvature= 5.55 mm), which of the following can be calculated?",
      "options": [" The axial length of the reduced eye   ", " The size of the exit pupil  ", " The thickness of the retinal surface  ", " The height of the object  "],
      "answers": [" The axial length of the reduced eye   "],
      "explanation": "Initially, one can determine the power of the refracting surface of the reduced eye by using the equation P=(n'-n)/r where P= the power of the refracting surface, n'= the refractive index of the surface, n= the refractive index of the surrounding medium, and r= the radius of curvature of the surface in meters. Using the known values given in the problem, one can calculate the value of P, P=(1.33-1.0)/0.00555= +59.46 D; rounding up to the nearest whole diopter yields +60.00 D. The value of P is then inserted into the equation L'=L+P where L'=the image vergence (n'/l' in meters), L=the object vergence (n/l in meters), and P=the power of the refracting surface. The value of the object vergence (L) is 0 because the object rays are parallel. Therefore, solving for L'=60.00 +0, (n'/l')=60.00 D, 1.33/l'=60, l'=0.02216 or 22.2 mm."

        " An object located at the far point of the eye will require more accommodation to achieve a clear retinal image than an object that is located closer to the eye  "
      ],
      "answers": [" The longer the axial length of the eye, the greater the vergence required at the corneal plane for an object to be clearly imaged on the retina   "],
      "explanation": "The far-point vergence relationship can be expressed as the equation A= F(fp) + P (eye), where A= 1.33/a, a= the axial length of the eye, F(fp)= the far point vergence, and P= the power of the reduced eye (+60.00 D). An eye with an increased axial length will require an increased vergence in order for an object to be focused in the retinal plane. An eye with an increased axial length will also have a decreased far point. For example, with an eye with a power of +60.00 D has an axial length of 26.00 mm, what power of corrective lens when placed at the corneal plane will result in a clear retinal image? Using the above equation: 1.33/0.026= F(fp)+ 60.00 D, solving for F(fp)= -8.85 D; therefore this eye has -8.85 D of myopia and will require a vergence of -8.85 D to produce a clear retinal image; this can be achieved by placing a -8.85 D corrective lens at the corneal plane. The far point of the eye can be located by solving for the reciprocal of the vergence; 1/8.85= 0.113 or 11.3 cm. The greater the axial length, the closer the far point of the eye. An uncorrected highly myopic patient will have to hold an object closer to their eye to achieve a clear retinal image than an uncorrected, mildly myopic patient. &#10;&#10;An object that is placed closer than the far point of the eye will require more accommodation to achieve a clear retinal image than an object that is placed further than the far point."

      ],
      "answers": [" The cornea and lens must both lose refractive power as the axial length increases  "],
      "explanation": "The axial length of the human eye at birth is typically around 17mm; this measurement increases roughly 25% by the time a child reaches adolescence. As the eye grows in length, the optical power of the eye's refracting system must concurrently weaken in a tightly coordinated fashion in order to keep a clear image focused on the retina. Therefore, the optical components of the eye, which include they cornea and crystalline lens, must both lose refractive power in order to compensate for the growth of the eye that occurs as children mature. At birth, the power of the cornea is typically about 48 diopters; the refractive power of the crystalline lens is close to 45 diopters. Typically, the cornea will lose about 4-5 diopters of power, while the crystalline lens will lose about 20 diopters of power as the axial length increases to an average of 24mm. This developmental process is known as emmetropization. If the process does not occur in this precise manner, myopia or hyperopia will develop. &#10;&#10;Adler's Physiology of the Eye 11th Edition.

      "explanation": "Against motion is observed when the far point of the patient's eye is located between the retinoscope and the patient's eye. Remember against motion indicates the presence of myopia. Light rays reflected from the retina of a myopic eye will emerge convergently because the far point of the eye is in front of the cornea. For a myope, the far point will be located in front of the eye but at a finite distance (that is it will not be located at optical infinity). The far point of a myopic eye is always located in front of the eye. &#10;&#10;Conversely, with motion (accounting for working distance) results when the far point of the eye is positioned behind the retinoscope and therefore signals a hyperope. &#10;&#10;Neutral motion (accounting for working distance) occurs when the far point of the eye is located at the viewing aperture of the retinoscope and indicates emmetropia."

      "answers": [" The principal meridians of the cornea are not perpendicular to each other  "],
      "explanation": "Astigmatism can be classified as either being regular or irregular. Regular astigmatism occurs in individuals in which the principal meridians of the cornea are located 90 degrees apart. That is, the area of the cornea with the flattest curvature (the axis) is oriented perpendicular to the meridian of the steepest curvature. &#10;&#10;In certain ocular conditions such as keratoconus, corneal scarring, or post-surgical corneas, the steep and flat meridians may not be oriented 90 degrees apart. This type of corneal curvature can be considered irregular astigmatism. In these cases, the refractive error is typically not well corrected with spectacles, in comparison to correction with gas-permeable contact lenses."

      "explanation": "When the sleeve is pushed down as far as the instrument will allow, the emerging light from the retinoscope is divergent, as the mirror is in a plano position. Moving the sleeve all the way to the top of the instrument causes emerging light to be convergent because the mirror of the retinoscope is in a concave position. This will reverse the direction of the reflex; therefore, if with-motion was observed with the sleeve down, against-motion will be observed with the sleeve pushed up."

This technique requires a special polarized slide. This allows for monocular testing without occlusion of the fellow eye. Some disadvantages of this method include decreased contrast of the targets potentially leading to poor end results. Another disadvantage is that strong eye dominance may lead to eye suppression rendering this method more challenging."

In this case, the vertical meridian would have a shorter radius of curvature indicating that it possesses a greater dioptric power than the horizontal meridian. If the steeper meridian lies between 60 and 120 degrees, the cornea is said to have with-the-rule astigmatism. If the steeper meridian lies between 150 and 30 degrees, the cornea displays against-the-rule astigmatism. Anything outside of these meridians is considered oblique astigmatism."

      "explanation": "The Turville method is a type of binocular refraction where neither eye is occluded. In this technique a septum is placed between the eye chart and the patient creating a situation where each eye sees a separate portion of the chart. Therefore each eye cannot see the target of the other eye. In such an instance, central fusion is suppressed but peripheral fusion is maintained. Each eye can be isolated without occlusion by directing the patient's gaze to the appropriate side of the test chart. This method works well for most individuals but may pose a problem for those who may suppress an eye, people with strabismus or those with high phorias or amblyopia."

      "answers": [" You cannot conclude the type of refractive error based upon the above findings  "],
      "explanation": "With motion can be observed in hyperopia, myopia and astigmatism; therefore, until the reflex is neutralized with retinoscopy and the working distance is accounted for, one cannot accurately deduce the type of refractive error without any lenses in place. For example, performing retinoscopy at a working distance of 50cm on a 1.00 D myope with no lenses in place will initially display with-motion of the reflex. Neutralization of the reflex will require the addition of +1.00 D (gross retinoscopy). To determine the net refractive error, the working distance must be subtracted from the gross retinoscopy findings. Because the working distance is 50cm, 2.00 D must be subtracted (reciprocal of the working distance) from the above gross findings of +1.00 D, yielding a net of -1.00 D."

Because the image is located within the second medium (barium glass) and not in air, the index of refraction that should be used in the equation is 1.60 and not 1.00 (index of air). The correct equation is L'=1.60/0.30= +5.33 D. It is important to convert the distance from centimeters into meters.

Therefore, in the above example, if the angle of incidence is 70 degrees so is the angle of reflectance. The normal is always located perpendicular to the surface (in this case, the mirror), which is a right angle and measures 90 degrees. If the angle of reflectance measures 70 degrees, the angle made between the angle of reflectance and the mirror must be equal to 90-70, which is 20 degrees."

      "explanation": "Risk factors that are thought to contribute to the development or progression of myopia include prolonged periods of near work on a consistent basis and a family history of myopia, especially if both parents are myopic. Studies have demonstrated the prevalence of myopia at 33-60% in children whose parents are both myopic, whereas the prevalence decreases to 23-40% in children with one parent who is myopic. Children who are emmetropic or have less than 0.50 D of hyperopia when they are school age are also at greater risk for developing myopia. Children with against-the-rule astigmatism are also thought to have a higher likelihood of becoming myopic. High axial length to corneal radius ratios, steep corneal curvatures, near point esophoria, and poor accommodative skills all also are thought to contribute to myopia development or progression. Lastly, anything that interferes with obtaining a clear retinal image during infancy (such as a corneal opacity or a vitreous hemorrhage) will likely cause myopia."

      "answers": [" 10mm   "],
      "explanation": "When the Schirmer test is performed properly, patients with normal tear production will have a total amount of tear secretion that wets at least 10mm of the filter paper after a period of 5 minutes in the eye. &#10;&#10;Before placing the Schirmer strip in the eye, the eye should be gently dried of any excess tears using a cotton-tipped applicator at the inferior conjunctival fornices on both sides. The filter paper should be folded 5mm from one end and placed in the lower conjunctival sac near the junction of the middle and outer third of the lower eyelid. Care should be taken not to touch the strip to the cornea or eyelashes upon insertion. After 5 minutes, the filter paper should be removed and the amount of paper that is moist is measured from the fold."

      "answers": [" 45 diopters   "],
      "explanation": "The refractive power of the human crystalline lens average 45 diopters in infancy. As the axial length of the eye increases as a child grows, the crystalline lens, in a coordinated effort, will lose about 20 diopters of power by the age of 6. This process is part of emmetropization, in which the refractive power of the cornea also decreases to maintain a clear image on the retina as the eye becomes lengthened. &#10;&#10;Adler's Physiology of the Eye 11th Edition.

      "explanation": "Measuring levator function (upper eyelid excursion) is a very helpful test in aiding in the diagnosis of a ptosis and identifying the underlying etiology. The measurement is achieved by having the patient look down while placing a thumb firmly against the brow to negate the action of the frontalis muscle. The patient is then instructed to look up as far as possible, and the amount of excursion is measured with a ruler. &#10;- Average levator function is about 15mm &#10;- A value of 12mm or above is considered 'good' &#10;- 'Fair' levator function is 5-11mm &#10;- 4mm or less is considered 'poor' &#10;- Typically anything below 12mm is considered abnormal"

      "answers": [" 72 hours   "],
      "explanation": "Oral acyclovir is the mainstay of therapy for patients diagnosed with herpes zoster ophthalmicus. This systemic treatment is maximally beneficial if it is initiated within 72 hours from the onset of the disease (usually the appearance of eyelid lesions). The use of oral acyclovir typically results in quick resolution of skin vesicles, decreases the amount of pain the patient experiences, and reduces the duration of viral shedding and appearance of new lesions. Acyclovir has also been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of ocular findings such as episcleritis, keratitis, and iritis. The recommended dosage is 800mg orally 5 times per day for 7-10 days."

      ],
      "answers": [" A child born with a large congenital cataract in one eye only   "],
      "explanation": "Form deprivation amblyopia results when a clear and focused retinal image is blocked to one eye during the critical period. This can occur by a complete congenital cataract in one eye, a large ptosis that covers most or all of the pupil or by some other element that occludes the eye. The lack of visual information to the retina causes the other eye (non-occluded eye) to become dominant and thusly have stronger and a greater number of synaptic connections to the brain. Amblyopia causes a disproportionate amount of cortical neurons to respond preferentially to the non-deprived eye. The occlusion must occur during the critical period, and the earlier the occlusion is detected and removed, the better the prognosis. A small ptosis (i.e. 2 mm) would not be expected to cause amblyopia because the pupil would not be occluded. An unequal prescription such as the one in the above question would cause anisometropic amblyopia in which one eye would receive a clear image while the other would receive a blurry image. The brain would favor the clear retinal image, resulting in a strong dominance of cortical neurons for the least ametropic eye. Strabismus results in the perception of two images that are not fusible by the brain, causing diplopia. In order to eliminate double vision, the eye will suppress an eye (usually the deviated eye). This suppression leads to amblyopia.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Congenital Lens Anomalies"

      "options": [" A Mittendorf's dot  ", " A persistent pupillary membrane  ", " A cerulean cataract  ", " A lamellar cataract  "],
      "answers": [" A cerulean cataract  "],
      "explanation": "A cerulean cataract is also known as a 'blue dot' cataract and generally is seen in the lenticular periphery, although it can be scattered throughout the lens. This type of congenital cataract is fairly common but rarely affects visual acuity. &#10;&#10;A Mittendorf's dot is on the posterior aspect of the lens and serves as a remnant of the hyaloid system that had previously been attached to the lens. &#10;&#10;During the third month of development, mesenchymal cells migrate between the lens epithelium and the corneal epithelium to form a transitory network of blood vessels anterior to the lens. This is the pupillary membrane. At 6 months of development, the central blood vessels atrophy and the peripheral vessels increase their contribution to the lesser circle of the iris. By 8.5 months of development, the central vessels fragment and disappear, although they can sometimes persist and appear as web-like projections attached to the iris surface. &#10;&#10;A lamellar cataract, also known as a zonular cataract, is attributable to a fleeting exposure to some type of cataract-inducing event or substance. The cataract is limited to one or several layers of the lens, allowing the practitioner to determine during which time frame of the developmental period the exposure occurred. The fetal nucleus is commonly involved. This type of cataract can have an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern but is not always congenital in origin. &#10;&#10;Reference: Wilson, E., Trivedi, R., and Pandey, S.

      "explanation": "Premium multifocal intraocular lenses are great options for many patients, particularly those who wish to have freedom from glasses. However, due to the diffractive optics of multifocal lenses, contrast sensitivity may be reduced. Patients with normal vision typically do not experience a decrease in contrast sensitivity; however, patients with macular disease or those with glaucoma and associated field loss may suffer a significant loss of contrast sensitivity. Monofocal, toric, aspheric and accommodating intraocular lenses do not typically degrade vision and may serve as better options for glaucoma patients with visual field defects."

      "answers": [" Actinic keratosis   "],
      "explanation": "Actinic keratosis is a precursor to squamous cell carcinoma and appears as scaly, dry skin that does not heal. People with skin that is of lighter pigmentation along with excessive exposure to ultraviolet light tend to be most at risk for development of this condition. &#10;&#10;Papillomas may take on various forms and may be viral or non-viral in origin. They can commonly be found on the eyelids or surrounding orbital skin. Viral warts tend to grow at an accelerated rate while non-viral papillomas are fairly slow to grow. Papillomas can mimic neoplastic growths so be sure to rule this out while watching carefully for color change, ulceration, lash loss, bleeding, and vascularization. &#10;&#10;Cutaneous horns or tags are also benign and are likely a form of papilloma but appear to involve more keratin. Treatment is similar to that of a papilloma. &#10;&#10;Seborrhoeic keratosis is more commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly persons. This benign, epidermal growth is quite superficial and does not extend into the dermis. It appears like a brown plaque that has been stuck onto someone's skin. The borders are very distinct and there may be some elevation. The lesions may be removed if the patient is concerned about cosmesis."

      "explanation": "When the patient presents with an anterior uveitis that has an initial presentation, occurs unilaterally, and the patient is otherwise healthy with no other systemic symptoms, no further laboratory testing is usually indicated. On the other hand, patients with recurrent, chronic, or bilateral presentations, or patients that have other symptoms possibly indicating the presence of an associated systemic condition, should undergo a thorough work-up to determine the underlying etiology. Typically, in conjunction with the patient's primary care provider, laboratory testing should be initiated in a patient where anterior uveitis recurs after cessation of treatment (2nd episode). In these cases, there is a much higher risk of being associated with a systemic disease, as compared to a patient with a single episode of intraocular inflammation. &#10;&#10;When indicated, minimal lab testing should include the following: &#10;- Complete blood cell count (CBC) &#10;- Urinalysis &#10;- Lyme titers &#10;- HLA-B27 test (spondylarthropathies) &#10;- Antinuclear antibody (ANA) test (juvenile arthritis) &#10;- Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) test (sarcoidosis) &#10;- Venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test (syphilis) &#10;- Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test (syphilis)"

      "answers": [" Albumin   ", " Lactoferrin   ", " Lysozyme   ", " Glycoproteins   "],
      "explanation": "The major proteins found in tears include: albumin, lysozymes, lactoferrin, IgA, IgG, secretory component, glycoproteins, antiproteinases, tissue plasminogen activator and the epidermal growth factor. &#10;&#10;Albumin's role in tears is not yet fully understood. It is purported to help regulate tear osmolarity and aid in regulating the flow of fluid. &#10;&#10;Lysozymes and lactoferrin are responsible for bacteriostatic activity. Lysozymes are hydrolytic and lactoferrin chelates iron which is needed for bacterial function. &#10;&#10;IgA and secretory component are useful for destroying bacteria. &#10;&#10;Glycoproteins are needed for proper mucous function. Antiproteinase concentration increases in the presence of infection and may serve to inhibit hydrolytic enzymes produced by bacteria. Tissue plasminogen activator is required to activate plasmin which is necessary for wound healing, as is the epidermal growth factor. &#10;&#10;Creatine is produced by the liver and kidneys as an energy source used primarily by muscle cells. &#10;&#10;Serotonin is a neurotransmitter. Altered levels of this neurotransmitter have been associated with depression among other ailments. &#10;&#10;Glutathione is a powerful antioxidant. Low levels of this tripeptide have been linked with cataract formation."

      "explanation": "If a topical steroid is indicated in a patient who has a history of steroid-induced ocular hypertension, glaucoma, or is under the age of 10, it is often sufficient to prescribe an ester-based steroid (such as loteprednol) to control the signs and symptoms of an inflammatory reaction. Ester-based corticosteroids tend to cause less pressure elevation for a given amount of anti-inflammatory effect in comparison to ketone-based steroids (dexamethasone and prednisolone). &#10;&#10;http://www.revoptom.com/content/s/89/c/15591/"

The non-pigmented epithelium is the most internal layer of the ciliary body and comes into contact with the aqueous humor. An important fact to remember is that the apexes of the non-pigmented epithelium of the ciliary body face towards the exterior of the eye, while the cells of the pigmented epithelium apexes face internally; therefore, the cells of these two layers face apex to apex."

      ],
      "answers": [" Aqueous moves downward near the cornea where the temperature is cooler, and upward near the iris where the temperature is warmer   "],
      "explanation": "Aqueous humor is secreted into the posterior chamber of the eye by the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium lining the ciliary processes. It then flows through a narrow area between the anterior surface of the crystalline lens and posterior surface of the iris into the anterior chamber. Within the anterior chamber, there is a convection current of the aqueous humor that is driven by the temperature difference between the warmer iris and cooler cornea. Aqueous rises upward in the back of the anterior chamber where the temperature is warmer, and falls downward near the cornea where the temperature is cooler. Aqueous eventually leaves the eye via bulk flow through two pathways in the anterior chamber: the conventional route through the trabecular meshwork, and secondarily through the uveoscleral pathway. &#10;&#10;The Eye's Aqueous Humor; Edition 2.

      "answers": [" Glutathione   "],
      "explanation": "Glutathione is a tripeptide molecule that is a combination of the amino acids glutamine, cysteine, and glycine. It provides the most protection against oxidative damage to the crystalline lens due to its very high concentration in the lens, along with the sulfhydryl group of the molecule that is readily oxidized. Studies have shown that when glutathione levels in the crystalline lens are lowered, cell damage and the formation of cataracts rapidly occur. &#10;&#10;Crystalline lens epithelial cells and superficial lens fiber cells have the ability to synthesize glutathione, which can be transported into the lens from the aqueous humor. Reduced glutathione can also be regenerated from the oxidized form of glutathione by the action of glutathione reductase and NADPH. Fiber cells that are deeper within the crystalline lens have a lesser ability to synthesize and reduce glutathione; therefore, they must obtain glutathione by diffusion from the more superficial fibers. &#10;&#10;Adler's Physiology of the Eye.

      "answers": [" Helps to trap debris and bacteria   ", " Primarily secreted by conjunctival goblet cells   "],
      "explanation": "The mucous layer is the least superficial layer of the tear film and is composed of two sub-layers. The innermost layer is the glycocalyx, which is secreted by underlying epithelial cells. The outer layer is a mucous layer primarily produced by conjunctival goblet cells. Mucous molecules are hydrophilic allowing for a lessening of the surface tension of the tear film's aqueous component which allows the aqueous layer to distribute evenly over the cornea. Due to the physical properties of mucous, it is effective in trapping unwanted debris and bacteria. &#10;&#10;The quality of the mucous layer and overall integrity of the tear film can be assessed via a tear break up test. The Schirmer tear strip test is a measure of tear production specifically the aqueous component of the tears."

      "explanation": "The lens is made up of two general types of proteins; the crystallins which are water-soluble and the albumanoids (which are not water-soluble). There are three sub-types of crystalline proteins; alpha, beta and gamma. The beta proteins account for roughly 55% of the crystallin proteins found within the lens. All of the beta crystalline proteins have a beta protein structure. The beta crystallins can be further divided based upon their molecular weights (beta high and beta low). The gamma crystallin proteins constitute 15% of the lens proteins. The alpha crystallins comprise 15% of the lens proteins and have four different subunits-A1, A2, B1 and B2. The remaining 15% of the lens proteins are made up of insoluble albumanoids."

      "question": "An elderly patient presents in your office with decreased visual acuity. He remarks that he can read better without his glasses and his refraction denotes a large myopic shift.

      "options": [" Bilateral crocodile shagreen  ", " Bilateral limbal girdle of Vogt  ", " Bilateral corneal arcus  ", " Bilateral 3+ nuclear sclerosis of the lens   "],
      "answers": [" Bilateral 3+ nuclear sclerosis of the lens   "],
      "explanation": "Nuclear sclerosis is caused by changes to the optical clarity of the lens. As we age, proteins precipitate out of the lens matrix, causing the lens to become cloudy and altering its density. As time passes, the lens will also begin to change color from clear to a yellow/brown in a process called lens brunescence. Cataracts also generally cause a myopic shift with an increase in against-the-rule astigmatism, leading to decreased distance vision but improved near vision. &#10;&#10;Corneal arcus is caused by lipid deposition in the peripheral cornea. There remains a characteristic clear zone between the lipid and the limbus. Arcus does not generally interfere with vision. &#10;&#10;Crocodile shagreen and limbal girdle of Vogt are also benign corneal findings commonly seen in the elderly. Crocodile shagreen appears in the peripheral cornea as polygonal white opacities. Limbal girdle of Vogt is noted at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock interpalpebral positions as white crescent-shaped opacities."

      "answers": [" Dermatochalasis   "],
      "explanation": "Dermatochalasis refers to excess upper lid skin, which leads to the appearance of baggy eyelids and a pseudoptosis. Typically, there is associated laxity of the eyelid skin and loss of muscle tone. It is most commonly observed in elderly patients as a result of aging skin and muscle changes. In patients with dermatochalasis, if the redundant upper eyelid tissue is retracted, the position of the upper lid is typically normal; this is an important differentiating factor between a pseudoptosis seen in conjunction with dermatochalasis and a true eyelid ptosis. &#10;&#10;Entropion is an abnormal inward rotation of the eyelid margin and tarsus toward the globe.&#10;&#10;Blepharochalasis is a condition of the upper eyelids that results from recurrent episodes of non-painful, non-pitting edema. It leads to the appearance of redundant, wrinkled, and atrophic upper eyelid skin. &#10;&#10;Floppy eyelid syndrome most commonly affects middle-aged, obese men who sleep face-down; this results in friction of the lids against the pillow, causing the lids to become everted. The loose and rubbery tarsal plates and excessive upper eyelid skin makes the lids easily evert with the application of gentle pressure on the skin below the brow."

This can also be a congenital condition in which case the condition is known as ankyloblepharon filiform adnatum. &#10;&#10;Blepharophimosis describes a condition in which the lateral and medial canthals are fused together resulting in a narrowing of the palpebral fissure. &#10;&#10;A lid coloboma occurs when there is a developmental failure of the eyelid to form completely and appears as a large notch caused by missing tissue. It is most commonly located on the upper eyelid. &#10;&#10;Dermatochalasis is seen in elderly patients. This condition results from loss of elasticity of the skin causing the skin to sag sometimes drooping into the visual axis."

      "explanation": "Yellowish pigmentation of the conjunctiva, skin, and other mucous membranes is known as jaundice. Jaundice is caused by increased levels of bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia), which subsequently leads to an elevated concentration of bilirubin in the extracellular fluid. Normal blood plasma levels of bilirubin should be below 1.2 mg/dL. Concentrations above about 3mg/dL typically lead to jaundice. Jaundice is most often seen in liver disease (such as hepatitis) or liver cancer. Therefore, if a patient presents with yellowish discoloration of the sclera, liver function tests should be ordered immediately."

      "answers": [" External hordeolum   "],
      "explanation": "Hordeolum (likely called a stye by most patients) are classified as either internal or external depending on their location. Hordeolum are considered an infection and tend to be acute and associated with some degree of pain. Most infections are caused by Staphylococcus and result in the formation of pus. Often there is a concurrent blepharitis. Primary treatment involves warm compresses as frequently as possible to draw out the infection and allow for drainage. Most practitioners will prescribe a topical antibiotic more for prophylactic purposes than for treatment because, when the hordeolum expresses its contents, conjunctivitis may result. &#10;&#10;Chalazia are not considered infections and are generally a result of lipogranulomatous material that cannot be reabsorbed by the body. Chalazia typically are not acute and cause little, if any, pain. Chalazia can grow to be quite large and last for a long time. The primary treatment is frequent warm compresses and digital massage. Some practitioners prescribe oral antibiotics; however, this is more likely to treat concurrent meibomitis rather than the chalazion as little, if any, microbial activity is present. Some practitioners follow the rule that if the chalazia is greater than 6 mm or has been present for more than six months, it will not regress with warm compresses and digital massage. In this event, either steroid injection or surgical excision of the chalazia may be warranted. Remember, a recurring chalazion in the same spot is VERY suspicious for a carcinoma of the meibomian gland and should be biopsied."

      "options": [" Chronic anterior uveitis  ", " High myopia  ", " Acute angle closure  ", " Hereditary fundus dystrophies  "],
      "answers": [" Chronic anterior uveitis  "],
      "explanation": "The most common cause of a secondary cataract (one in which a cataract develops as a result of some other primary disease of the eye) is chronic anterior uveitis. Long-standing intraocular inflammation can lead to prolonged breakdown of the blood-aqueous and/or blood-vitreous barrier. Additionally, patients with chronic inflammation are likely to be on long-term treatment with either systemic or topical corticosteroids; this is an important associated feature. &#10;&#10;Acute angle closure can cause small, grayish opacities that typically appear within the pupil area that are a result of focal infarcts of the crystalline lens epithelium (known as glaukomflecken). &#10;&#10;High myopia has been shown to be associated with early-onset of nuclear sclerosis and the formation of posterior subcapsular lenticular opacities. &#10;&#10;Retinitis pigmentosa, gyrate atrophy, and Leber congenital amaurosis are hereditary fundus dystrophies that have an association to posterior subcapsular cataracts."

      "answers": [" Chronic blepharitis  "],
      "explanation": "While all of the above options other than lid myokymia can cause trichiasis, the most common cause stems from chronic blepharitis. Trichiasis can cause irritation, discomfort, lacrimation, corneal epithelial defects, and, if left untreated for long periods of time, scarring. Treatment includes epilation, bandage contact lenses, cauterization, electrolysis, cryosurgery, or Argon laser photocoagulation of the offending follicle or follicles. In the event of blepharitis, it is important to prescribe proper lid hygiene."

      "answers": [" Non-pigmented ciliary epithelium   "],
      "explanation": "Aqueous formation by the process of active secretion occurs as a result of secretion of ions by the non-pigmented layer of the ciliary epithelium. This leads to an accumulation of ions in the posterior chamber due to the presence of tight junctions that exist between the non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells. A strong osmotic pressure difference is then created across the ciliary epithelial cells, which subsequently causes water to passively move into the posterior chamber. Active secretion accounts for the vast majority of aqueous humor production (80-90%) in comparison to passive secretion (ultrafiltration and diffusion)."

      "answers": [" Ciliocapsular   "],
      "explanation": "The association fibers serve to brace and support the zonules. This group is further divided into three parts. The first group is the orbiculociliary division which arises from the pars plana and connects to the ciliary processes. The second division, the interciliary fibers, run between the ciliary processes and connect the processes to each other. The last sub-division is the circular fibers which run between the zonules serving to connect them in a circular pattern like a spider web. &#10;&#10;Ciliocapsular fibers are classified as principal fibers which are important for supporting the lens and accommodation. The ciliocapsular group arises from the sides and valleys of the ciliary processes and inserts onto the lens. This group also is further divided into two divisions the first of which is the cilio-posterior-capsular which runs from the sides and valleys of the ciliary processes and inserts onto the lens posterior to the equator. The second division, the cilio-equatorial-capsular group runs from the anterior sides of the ciliary processes and inserts onto the lenticular equator."

      "explanation": "The lens alters its shape to focus on images. When we need to visualize an image up close, the ciliary muscle contracts which decreases the tension on the zonules, causing the lens to become more spherically shaped and steeper in curvature, thereby increasing its dioptric power. The opposite holds true for viewing of a distant image. Looking far away causes relaxation of the ciliary muscles, increasing tension on the zonules allowing for the lens to become more elliptical and flatter in curvature, thereby decreasing its power."

      "explanation": "Both laser/white light interferometry and the potential acuity meter (PAM) may be used to help determine a patient's prospective acuity if the cataract or medial opacity were to be removed. PAM tends to underestimate the potential acuity of patients with cataracts, but over-predicts the acuity of patients with macular problems such as macular degeneration, cystoid macular degeneration and serous detachments. Both contrast sensitivity and visual fields may demonstrate depressions in a patient with cataracts, but this information cannot be used to determine a patient's potential acuity. Brightness acuity testing is utilized to assess the extent to which cataracts may be causing disabling glare or decreased acuity even though conventional methods of testing visual acuity do not reveal a significantly reduced acuity."

      "answers": [" Muller's   ", " Levator palpebrae superioris   ", " Frontalis   "],
      "explanation": "The eyelid retractors are muscles of the face that serve to open the eyelids. The primary retractor of the upper lid is the levator palpebrae superioris. The levator originates on the orbital roof near the orbital apex. The levator muscle is about 40mm in length with an additional 14-20mm that represents the levator aponeurosis. The aponeurosis splits in the anterior and posterior portions, which insert at the pretarsal orbicularis and the anterior surface of the tarsus, respectively. &#10;&#10;Muller's muscle is also important in opening the upper lid. It originates underneath the levator aponeurosis and extends to insert at the superior tarsal border. This muscle is responsible for about 2mm of elevation of the upper lid. &#10;&#10;The frontalis muscle also acts as a weak retractor of the eyelid but is mostly responsible for lifting the eyebrows. By elevating the eyebrows, the frontalis may provide an additional 2mm of retraction of the upper eyelids. &#10;&#10;Ocular Surface Disease: Conjunctiva and Tear Film: Expert Consult.

      "answers": [" Senile hyaline plaque   "],
      "explanation": "A senile hyaline plaque (also known a senile scleral translucency) is commonly seen on the temporal aspect of the sclera in front of the insertion of the lateral rectus or nasally in front of the insertion of the medial rectus in patients over the age of 50. The color of the plaque is attributable to scleral thinning, which allows for increased visibility of the uveal coat. This condition is benign and generally does not require treatment. &#10;&#10;Crocodile shagreen and limbal girdle of Vogt are also benign corneal findings commonly seen in the elderly. Crocodile shagreen appears in the peripheral cornea as polygonal white opacities. Limbal girdle of Vogt is noted at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock interpalpebral positions as white crescent-shaped opacities. &#10;&#10;Necrotizing scleritis is the most severe form of scleritis and is associated with scleral thinning, but this condition is not considered benign. Necrotizing scleritis has a higher mortality rate than the other types presented due to the fact that it usually stems from autoimmune diseases."

      "options": [" Cyclopentolate  ", " Loteprednol  ", " Prednisolone  ", " Proparacaine  ", " Tropicamide  ", " Neosynephrine   "],
      "answers": [" Neosynephrine   "],
      "explanation": "Episcleritis is a condition in which there is observable inflammation of the connective tissue that lies between the sclera and the conjunctiva. It is typically a benign condition that presents as a sudden occurrence of ocular redness and discomfort that is commonly noted sectorally in the interpalpebral region (but can be diffuse). In cases of simple episcleritis, the edema is typically localized to the area overlying the sclera, the sclera is not usually thickened, and associated uveitis is rare. Differential diagnosis of this type of ocular redness is conjunctivitis (which is more superficial) or scleritis (which is deeper). A commonly used diagnostic test is to instill neosynephrine or phenylephrine into the affected eye, which will cause blanching of the overlying conjunctival vessels as well as the episcleral vessels. This will aid in distinguishing between cases of acute episcleritis and scleritis."

Koeppe nodules are observed at the iris pupillary border, in contrast to Busacca nodules, which are found in the mid-iris stroma. Koeppe nodules have an appearance similar to that of mutton-fat keratic precipitates that may be observed on the corneal endothelium and commonly disappear within a few days after their initial presentation. These nodules may precipitate synechia due to their placement at the pupil border. Busacca nodules tend to be more abundant and are less transient in nature. &#10;&#10;Dalen-Fuchs nodules are chorioretinal lesions that are typically associated with such diseases as Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome and sympathetic ophthalmia.

      "explanation": "There are several conditions that may cause the false appearance of a ptosis (pseudoptosis) that should be differentiated from a 'true' ptosis. An ipsilateral hypotropia may cause a pseudoptosis due to the association between the location of the upper eyelid and the position of the globe (the lid will follow the eye downward). Once the patient assumes fixation of the hypotropic eye, the pseudoptosis will disappear. &#10;&#10;The presence of dermatochalasis can also produce a pseudoptosis due to the excessive skin on the upper eyelids. Once the skin is held up or removed, it is usually apparent that the position of the upper lid margin is not abnormal (unless other factors are present). &#10;&#10;Contralateral lid retraction, brow ptosis, and lack of support of the lids (due to an orbital volume deficit) may also lead to the presence of a pseudoptosis. The lid position in Horner's syndrome, myasthenia gravis, and third nerve palsies are considered a true ptosis."

Nodular scleritis appears similar to diffuse scleritis, but the areas of inflammation are localized to painful, raised nodules. Scleromalacia perforans is the least common form and is almost always seen in association with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with scleromalacia perforans generally do not experience pain or inflammation. Necrotizing scleritis is the most severe form and has a higher mortality rate than the other types due to the fact that it usually stems from autoimmune diseases. &#10;&#10;References: Schwartz, G.

      "question": "A 42-year old patient reports that her right eye has been watery and she has mild pain, redness, and swelling in the lower medial canthal region. You suspect dacryocystitis as the cause of her symptoms. Which of the following procedures is NOT appropriate when further evaluating this possible diagnosis?",
      "options": [" Dilation and irrigation of the lacrimal system   ", " Digital palpation of the medial canthal area  ", " Extraocular muscle motility  ", " Exophthalmometry  ", " Gram stain and blood agar cultures of discharge  "],
      "answers": [" Dilation and irrigation of the lacrimal system   "],
      "explanation": "The evaluation of a patient suspected of dacryocystitis should involve a detailed case history including a discussion of any previous episodes with similar symptoms, or the presence of any concomitant ear, nose, or throat irritation/infection. External examination of the patient should include the application of gentle pressure to the lacrimal sac region in order to attempt to express any discharge from the punctum; this should be done bilaterally. If any discharge can be recovered, a Gram stain or blood agar culture is helpful in determining the type of bacteria present. In addition to these tests, extraocular motility and evaluation for the presence of proptosis should be completed to rule out orbital cellulitis. In atypical, severe, or non-responding cases, a computed tomography scan (CT) should be considered. It is important to remember that probing, dilation, and/or irrigation of the lacrimal system should not be attempted during an acute infection of the lacrimal gland. This may cause the infection to spread to other areas such as the throat."

      "options": [" Distichiasis  ", " Hypertelorism  ", " Madarosis   ", " Tristichiasis  "],
      "answers": [" Madarosis   "],
      "explanation": "Blepharitis is a condition caused by pathogens, usually of Staphylococcus origin, that colonize along the eyelid margins. The bacteria produce exotoxins which take the form of flakes and are generally seen along the base of the eyelashes. Unfortunately, this condition is chronic but will wax and wane in its presentation. Long-term complications include madarosis (missing lashes), trichiasis, neovascularization of the eyelid margin, keratitis, erythema, phlyctenule formation and infiltrates. Patients may complain of dry, irritated eyes, stinging, pain, itching, frequent eye infections, foreign body sensation, and decreased acuity (if there is corneal involvement). Treatment includes eye lid scrubs, antibiotic ointments and sometimes transient topical steroid use to decrease lid inflammation (usually used in conjunction with a topical antibiotic). Occasionally oral antibiotics are prescribed, especially in the event of poor compliance. &#10;&#10;Distichiasis is a rare congenital phenomenon marked by an absence of meibomian glands. In the place of the meibomian glands is an extra row of eyelashes. &#10;&#10;Hypertelorism is a term used to describe the incidence in which the orbits are located quite far apart. This generally occurs along with other congenital cranium anomalies. &#10;&#10;Tristichiasis is a very rare occurrence in which a person possesses three rows of eyelashes."

      "options": [" Down and inward  ", " Up and outward  ", " Up and inward  ", " Down and outward  "],
      "answers": [" Down and inward  "],
      "explanation": "Common ocular sequelae that have been associated with a diagnosis of homocystinuria include ectopia lentis (bilateral crystalline lens subluxation), retinal detachment, and secondary glaucoma. In most cases of ectopia lentis, the lens is more likely to be displaced downward and inward in homocystinuria (as compared to upward and outward in Marfan's syndrome). Additionally, in homocystinuria, the lens zonules are markedly abnormal, the lens does not accommodate, and up to 1/3 of the cases of lens subluxation eventually completely dislocate into the vitreous or anterior chamber. Due to the severity of systemic and cardiovascular complications associated with homocystinuria (thrombosis and occlusion), patients presenting with ectopia lentis should be screened for this disease using the sodium nitroprusside test to measure homocysteine in the urine."

      "answers": [" Holocrine   "],
      "explanation": "Meibomian glands of the upper and lower eyelids are considered holocrine glands of the exocrine gland type. Glands of the human body can be categorized into two major groups, endocrine glands and exocrine glands. An endocrine gland secretes chemical regulators (hormones) directly into the bloodstream to act on tissues near the release site, while an exocrine gland secretes its products into ducts in order to reach some other environment external to itself (whether it be on the surface of or inside the body). &#10;&#10;Exocrine gland types can be further classified by their method of excretion. Merocrine glands excrete their substances by exocytosis. Apocrine glands have a portion of their plasma membrane that buds off of the cell, containing the substance to be excreted. Holocrine glands excrete their substances via rupturing of their own plasma membranes; the cell is also destroyed during this process. &#10;&#10;Barron's Anatomy and Physiology: The Easy Way (2nd edition).

      "answers": [" Pseudophakic bullous keratopathy   "],
      "explanation": "Patients who have pre-existing endothelial dystrophies prior to cataract surgery are at an increased risk of developing pseudophakic bullous keratopathy. Cataract surgery typically causes a loss of endothelial cells secondary to inadvertent manipulation and stress during the procedure. Patients with a decreased number of endothelial cells are at risk for longstanding corneal edema, which may require a lamellar or full thickness corneal transplant if the visual acuity suffers to a great extent. Patients who suffer from endothelial dystrophies do not have a higher risk of developing a retinal detachment or endophthalmitis post-surgically when compared to patients with normal corneas."

      "answers": [" Episclera-->stroma--> lamina fusca   "],
      "explanation": "The first layer of the sclera is the episclera, a thin and highly vascular layer. The second layer is the stroma and is sometimes also referred to as the sclera proper. The stromal layer makes up the majority of the sclera. Lastly, the lamina fusca is the most internal layer. This layer is the thinnest and most pigmented due to the population of melanocytes that reside here. The lamina fusca and the choroid are separated from each other by a potential space termed the perichoroidal space. This space is important as it houses nerves and arteries."

      "question": "A 27-year old male presents with decreased vision, pain, and redness of both eyes. Slit lamp examination reveals several large 'mutton-fat' keratic precipitates (KPs) on the corneal endothelial surface. Which two of the following types of cells make up these KPs? (Select 2)",
      "options": [" Epithelioid cells   ", " Macrophages   ", " Erythrocytes  ", " Lymphocytes  ", " Neutrophils  "],
      "answers": [" Epithelioid cells   ", " Macrophages   "],
      "explanation": "The presence of keratic precipitates (KPs) on the corneal endothelium is an anterior segment sign indicating the presence of uveitis. KPs are aggregates of inflammatory cells that are typically observed on the inferior half of the cornea due to the convection currents in the aqueous humour. Their composition and appearance differs with the severity, duration, and type of uveitis (non-granulomatous vs. granulomatous). &#10;&#10;Non-granulomatous KPs are composed of neutrophils and lymphocytes and have a clinical appearance that resembles small, discrete, fleck-like, linear, or stellate corneal endothelial opacities. These types of KPs are usually dirty-white in color and there may be hundreds in number arranged irregularly on the back surface of the cornea. On the other hand, mutton-fat KPs typically occur in granulomatous types of uveitis and are composed of macrophages and epithelioid cells. The appearance differs in that these types of KPs are much larger and thicker and they have a fluffy, greasy, or waxy look. Additionally, mutton-fat KPs are usually fewer in number (10-15). &#10;&#10;Other types of KPs include red KPs, which are formed when red blood cells are present in the anterior chamber in addition to the inflammatory cells (hemorrhagic uveitis). Old KPs may also be observed in cases of resolved uveitis. During the healing process, KPs tend to shrink, fade, and become pigmented and irregular in shape. Old mutton-fat KPs have been described of having a ground-glass appearance due to hyalinization."

      "options": [" Floppy eyelid syndrome  ", " Madarosis  ", " Dermatochalasis  ", " Blepharochalasis   "],
      "answers": [" Blepharochalasis   "],
      "explanation": "Blepharochalasis is typically seen in younger to middle-aged adults. This condition causes baggy eyelids due to excessive swelling and deswelling of the tissue, either from edema or inflammation. Eventually, the tissue loses its elasticity and may even mimic a ptosis. Ensure to rule out a ptosis and work with the primary care physician to determine the etiology. Treatment includes cool compresses, but steroid therapy seems to be of little value. A blepharoplasty may be warranted if the patient is unhappy with the cosmesis. &#10;&#10;Dermatochalasis tends to be seen in elderly patients and presents as bilateral baggy eyelids due to palpebral dermal redundancy. Treatment may include blepharoplasty, particularly if the visual field of the patient is compromised. In order to test the amount of visual field that is affected, one must first have the patient perform a visual field and then tape the eyelids up and out of the way and then re-run the visual field to demonstrate field loss secondary to lid droop. &#10;&#10;Floppy eyelid syndrome is typically seen in older, obese males. Generally, these patients tend to complain of foreign body sensation or excessive ocular irritation (especially upon awakening) due to the fact that their lids portray increased laxity and will sometimes evert while sleeping, causing papillary conjunctivitis. &#10;&#10;Madarosis presents as missing lashes either due to scar tissue, pathology (such as blepharitis), anti-cancer treatments, or physical removal. Ensure that there is no underlying systemic etiology (one would expect hair loss in other areas as well if the cause is systemic)."

      "explanation": "The lenticular epithelium is located on the anterior surface of the lens and is responsible for the transport of nutrients into the lens. The cells of the epithelium contain organelles, including a nucleus and the majority of cells are connected by gap junctions. The cells actively transport potassium, inositol and amino acids into the cell from the aqueous. Chloride ions, Ca2+, glucose and ascorbic acid enter the cell by diffusion (some via facilitation). While sodium ions are actively transported out of the cell (via Na/K ATPase pumps), lactic acid diffuses out of the cell."

      "answers": [" From the ciliary body onto the lens capsule   "],
      "explanation": "The zonules can be divided into two different groups based upon their function and attachment site to the lens, the principal fibers and the association fibers. The principal fibers control accommodation and support the lens. This group can be further separated into two groups: the orbiculocapsular group and the ciliocapsular (both of which contain further subdivisions). The orbiculocapsular group arise from the posterior ciliary body and insert onto the lens. There are two sub-categories within the orbiculocapsular group. The first is the orbicular-anterior-capsular group which runs from the posterior pars plana and inserts onto the lens anterior to the equator. The second subdivision, the orbicular-posterior-capsular group, originates at the ora serrata and courses over the ciliary body to insert onto the lens posterior to the equator. &#10;&#10;The ciliocapsular group arises from the sides and valleys of the ciliary processes and inserts onto the lens. This group also is further divided into two subdivisions; the first is the cilio-posterior-capsular group, which runs from the sides and valleys of the ciliary processes and inserts onto the lens posterior to the equator. The second division, the cilio-equatorial-capsular group, runs from the anterior sides of the ciliary processes and inserts onto the lenticular equator. &#10;&#10;The association fibers serve to brace and support the zonules. This group is further divided into three parts. The first group is the orbiculociliary division, which rises from the pars plana and connects to the ciliary processes. The second division, the interciliary fibers, run between the ciliary processes and connect the processes to each other. The last subdivision is the circular fibers which run between the zonules and serve to connect them in a circular pattern similar to a spider web."

      "answers": [" Glands of Zeis   "],
      "explanation": "An external hordeolum is an acute staphylococcal abscess of an eyelash follicle that is most commonly associated with the glands of Zeis, and less likely the glands of Moll. Patients typically present with a localized area of redness, tenderness, and swelling surrounding an eyelash follicle. The lesion will usually develop a whitish-yellow point at the surface of the lid margin. In most cases, it will drain spontaneously within several few days; however, the use of warm compresses usually speeds up the drainage process. In some cases, epilation of the affected eyelash may be considered to allow a channel and promote drainage. &#10;&#10;An internal hordeolum is an infection associated with the meibomian glands. The infection commonly results in blockage of the gland creating swelling, redness, warmth, and tenderness within the tarsus. The course of an internal hordeolum is typically more prolonged and usually requires more extensive treatment."

      "answers": [" Pseudoexfoliation syndrome  "],
      "explanation": "A patient with pseudoexfoliation syndrome, despite removal of the cataract, can still produce pseudoexfoliative material, which can further weaken the zonules. The weakening of the lenticular zonules can lead to dislocation of the intraocular lens implant, which is usually placed in the posterior capsule. Patients with this condition are also are an increased risk for rupture of the posterior capsule. A patient with pseudoexfoliation syndrome and iridodonesis will commonly have a capsular tension ring inserted at the time of cataract removal surgery; frequently, the IOL will either be placed in the sulcus or sutured in place to prevent dislocation. Patients with pseudoexfoliation syndrome are typically referred for cataract surgery as soon as the cataracts become clinically significant in order to minimize complications associated with the removal of dense cataracts. Although patients with multiple sclerosis and SLE may experience ocular complications associated with these conditions or their treatments, they are not at a higher risk of lens dislocation or posterior capsular rupture during phacoemulsification. &#10;&#10;Pseudoexfoliation syndrome: pathological manifestations of relevance to intraocular surgery.

Normal apertures measure roughly 9-12 mm in height and 30 mm wide. A height difference greater than 1 mm between the two eyes is considered to be abnormal. Common causes of interpalpebral height asymmetry include a ptosis of one eye, unilateral proptosis or exophthalmos of one eye. Proptosis is defined as a mechanical or passive protrusion of the eyeball, while exophthalmos is an active forward protrusion of the eyeball. &#10;&#10;Reference: Ahmed, E.

      "question": "Your 21 year-old female patient reports that her upper eyelid has been intermittently twitching for the past 2 weeks. She states that these symptoms typically occur before important tests and eventually resolve on their own. What is the MOST likely diagnosis of this ocular condition?",
      "options": [" Hemifacial spasm  ", " Eyelid myokymia   ", " Blepharospasm  ", " Blepharoclonus  "],
      "answers": [" Eyelid myokymia   "],
      "explanation": "A diagnosis of eyelid myokymia is characterized by the presence of intermittent, unilateral lid twitching or fluttering that may involve either the upper or lower eyelids. This ocular condition can occur as a result of several different triggering factors, most notably fatigue, stress, and increased levels of caffeine. This condition is generally benign and self-limiting, and it typically resolves within a period of several days to several weeks. &#10;&#10;Blepharoclonus is an ocular condition that is most commonly observed in young children, in which the etiology is frequently unknown. The condition may present as either an increase in blink rate, or increased duration of lid closure upon blinking. &#10;&#10;Patients diagnosed with blepharospasm will typically present with symptoms of uncontrollable eyelid closures, contractions, or twitches of the eyelid muscles. In some cases, the twitching will radiate to the nose, face, and even the neck area. Twitching in patients with blepharospasm are much more severe than that of eyelid myokymia (which is barely visible). &#10;&#10;Hemifacial spasm usually occurs in patients in their 5th to 6th decades of life. It is characterized by briefs spasms of the orbicularis oculi muscle, which eventually spreads to involve the facial area in the distribution of the facial nerve."

      "question": "In most cases of acute anterior uveitis, the intraocular pressure is decreased due to reduced secretion of aqueous by the ciliary epithelium. Which 2 of the following causes of acute anterior uveitis typically result in ELEVATED intraocular pressure? (Select 2)",
      "options": [" Herpes   ", " Behcet's syndrome  ", " Idiopathic  ", " Posner-Schlossman syndrome   ", " Bacterial infection  "],
      "answers": [" Herpes   ", " Posner-Schlossman syndrome   "],
      "explanation": "Patients presenting with acute anterior uveitis typically demonstrate a decrease in their intraocular pressure (IOP). This is due to the fact that an inflamed ciliary body often produces less aqueous as compared to its basal level of secretion. However, there are some etiologies of anterior uveitis that more commonly result in elevated intraocular pressures. In both herpetic uveitis and Posner-Schlossman syndrome, an increase in IOP can be attributed to subsequent trabeculitis, resulting in decreased outflow of aqueous. Therefore, IOP can be an important component to diagnosing the cause of a case of acute anterior uveitis. &#10;&#10;Pediatric Opthalmology: Current Thought and a Practical Guide.

      ],
      "answers": [" Horizontal canaliculi are shortened, puncta moves medially, and lacrimal sac expands  "],
      "explanation": "As a person closes his eyes during a blink, the pre-tarsal orbicularis oculi compresses the vertical component of the canaliculi and shortens the horizontal canaliculi, which in turn causes the puncta to move medially. Simultaneously, the lacrimal portion of the orbicularis oculi also contracts, which results in expansion of the lacrimal sac. This action creates negative pressure, which draws the tears from the ocular surface through the canaliculi and into the sac."

      "explanation": "The eyelid margin can be divided into the anterior lamella (ciliary portion) and posterior lamella (tarsal portion). These lamellae are separated from each other along what is known as the 'gray line', which represents the terminal extension of the muscle of Riolan within the eyelid. This muscle is present along the entire length of the eyelid margin, located between the tarsal plate and the eyelash follicles, and arises from the orbicularis oculi muscle. It is thought that the muscle of Riolan aids in maintaining proper apposition of the eyelid to the globe, as well as helping to express the contents of glands during blinking. &#10;&#10;Surgical Anatomy of the Ocular Adnexa: A Clinical Approach (2nd edition).

      "explanation": "The condition described in the above question is known as xanthelasma. Xanthelasma are yellowish, soft, velvety, raised lesions that typically present in the area of the upper eyelid near the medial canthus. These lesions generally occur in middle-aged or older adults and are more commonly observed in women. They typically present bilaterally and symmetrically and can enlarge in size over time. &#10;&#10;Xanthelasma has been associated with certain medical conditions including hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and cardiovascular changes. Of these disorders, the most commonly related condition is high cholesterol, in which close to 50% of patients presenting with xanthelasma will exhibit elevated lipid levels when tested. &#10;&#10;Management of xanthelasma should include blood testing and evaluation for the presence of various hyperlipidemias, if unknown. The eyelid lesions are usually observed but can be surgically excised in cases where an improvement in cosmesis is desired or if the lesion becomes uncomfortably enlarged. Occasionally, medical treatment alone for elevated serum lipids can bring about significant resolution of xanthelasma."

      "options": [" Hypertension  ", " Benign prostatic hyperplasia  ", " Obstructive sleep apnea  ", " Diabetes mellitus  ", " Obesity   "],
      "answers": [" Obesity   "],
      "explanation": "Floppy eyelid syndrome is an uncommon condition of the eyelids that may occur either unilaterally or bilaterally. It has been shown to primarily affect obese individuals with a predilection for the male gender. It is thought to be associated with habitual sleeping on the involved side of the face in overweight individuals that leads to upper lid eversion by a pillow; there is also an association with individuals suffering from sleep apnea. Examination of these patients reveals a decreased amount of elastic fibers in the tarsal plate and skin of the upper eyelid, leading to redundant lid tissue and loose and rubbery tarsal plates that evert easily with simple gentle pressure on the skin in the area just below the brow. Symptoms that patients may present with include ptosis, foreign body sensation (especially upon wakening), conjunctival injection, swelling, and mucous discharge. The presence of chronic papillary conjunctivitis, superficial punctate keratopathy, and corneal pannus are common associated ocular findings. &#10;&#10;Clinical characteristics show that 75% of patients with floppy eyelid syndrome are adult males between the ages of 30-80 years of age, with obesity is present in 96% of cases. Although obesity is by far the most common related condition, other possible associations include keratoconus, sleep apnea, diabetes, and mental retardation."

Allergy is also commonly seen and frequently accompanied by itching and conjunctival injection. &#10;&#10;It is always appropriate to obtain thyroid testing to rule out an under-active thyroid. Another syndrome that should be considered in periorbital edema is nephrotic syndrome characterized by edema and proteinuria (loss of protein in the urine).

      "answers": [" Hypopyon   "],
      "explanation": "In cases of uveitis in which there is an extensive amount of intraocular inflammation, cells tend to settle in the inferior portion of the anterior chamber, which can be observed on slit-lamp examination. This ocular finding is known as hypopyon. &#10;&#10;Hypotony is an ocular condition characterized by severely decreased intraocular pressure (IOP), typically 5-6mmHg or less. When IOP reaches these levels, there are usually associated anatomical and/or functional abnormalities of the eye that coexist, such as corneal striae, aqueous flare, choroidal effusions, and macular folds. &#10;&#10;Hyphema is an ocular finding in which blood is present in the anterior chamber. As in cases of hypopyon, red blood cells may also pool in the inferior region of the anterior chamber. &#10;&#10;Snow-banking is a term that is used in patients with intermediate uveitis in which aggregates of inflammatory cells can be observed lying over the inferior pars plana."

      "question": "During slit lamp evaluation of your 65 year-old patient with a long-standing history of diabetes, you carefully examine the anterior segment for evidence of rubeosis iridis. At which location on the iris are you MOST likely to observe abnormal blood vessel growth first?",
      "options": [
        " In the iris periphery near the anterior chamber angle  ",
        " In the mid-periphery lying deep within the iris stroma  ",

      ],
      "answers": [" Along the anterior surface of the iris at the pupillary margin   "],
      "explanation": "Rubeosis iridis (iris neovascularization) occurs as a result of severe retinal ischemia, typically secondary to diabetes mellitus, ischemic central retinal vein occlusion, and carotid obstructive disease. It is thought that hypoxic retinal tissue produces certain growth factors (such as vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF), in an attempt to re-vascularize these areas. In addition to causing neovascularization of the retinal tissue, these factors can diffuse into the anterior chamber, resulting in abnormal blood vessel growth within the iris and anterior chamber angle. &#10;&#10;In most cases, neovascularization is initially visible as tiny dilated capillary tufts coursing the surface of the iris at the pupillary margin. These vessels may be difficult to observe; therefore, careful examination of this region under high magnification is important in all patients with a risk for development of rubeosis iridis. As neovascularization progresses, these blood vessels will grow radially over the surface of the iris tissue towards the angle, which can impede aqueous outflow initially and eventually lead to secondary angle closure by contraction of the fibrovascular membrane. &#10;&#10;It is important to note that neovascularization of the angle in the absence of visible neovascularization at the pupillary margin can occur, but this is rare and typically only occurs in cases of an ischemic central retinal vein occlusion. Also, patients with lightly colored irides may have visible blood vessels within the iris stroma; this is a normal finding."

However, in the event that the trabecular meshwork becomes blocked by the cells and flare therefore hindering aqueous outflow, one would expect to observe an increase in IOP."

      "question": "Purkinje images are caused by reflections of objects on the cornea and lens. Which of the four images moves forward with accommodation?",
      "options": [" IV  ", " II  ", " III   ", " I  "],
      "answers": [" III   "],
      "explanation": "There are four Purkinje images. The first image is caused by reflection from the anterior corneal surface and is the brightest of the images. The first image is roughly the same size as the object. The second Purkinje image is formed by the posterior surface of the cornea and almost coincides with the first Purkinje image. The third Purkinje image is the largest and is caused by reflection off of the anterior plane of the crystalline lens. The fourth Purkinje image is the smallest and is inverted, formed by reflection off of the posterior surface of the lens. &#10;&#10;During the process of accommodation the anterior surface of the lens moves forward. The image that is reflected off of this surface is Purkinje III. Purkinje image III will be seen to move forward during accommodation."

      "question": "You wish to evaluate your patient's overall tear production. Which of the following tests assesses the volume of reflex AND basal tear secretions?",
      "options": [" Jones I dye test  ", " Schirmer I test   ", " Phenol red thread test  ", " Schirmer II test  "],
      "answers": [" Schirmer I test   "],
      "explanation": "The Schirmer I test is performed without anesthetic and therefore measures both the basal and reflex tear secretions. This test is conducted by placing a small strip of paper in the temporal region of the inferior cul-de-sac of the eye. The room illumination is dimmed and the patient is asked to blink normally. After five minutes, the length of the paper that is moist is measured. If greater than 10 mm of the paper is wet, the tear production is considered normal. The Schirmer II test is performed in conjunction with anesthetic, and therefore measures the basal tear production. Prior to the test, anesthetic is instilled into the eye. After one minute, the tears and excess anesthetic are removed from the inferior cul-de-sac. The test is then performed in the same fashion as the Schirmer I test. If greater than 5 mm of the paper is wet, the tear production is normal. Alternatively, the basal levels of tear secretion can be investigated by placing a specially coated thread (phenol red thread test) at the outer canthi of each eye for 15 seconds. The amount of thread that turns bright red (due to wetting of the phenol red dye) should measure greater than 10 mm for a normal result. The Jones I test evaluates the integrity of the tear drainage system. Sodium fluorescein is placed into the patient's eyes, and after five minutes the patient is asked to blow their nose. The tissue is evaluated for dye or, alternatively, a cotton-tipped applicator may be placed under the inferior turbinate and evaluated for the presence of dye. If dye is not observed, then there may be a blockage of the drainage system."

      "answers": [" Juxtacanalicular tissue   "],
      "explanation": "The uveal meshwork possesses the largest pore size and it is the first area of the trabecular meshwork through which the aqueous drains. The corneoscleral meshwork is the thickest portion of the trabecular meshwork and has pore sizes that are slightly smaller than those of the uveal meshwork. The juxtacanalicular layer is quite thin, around 10-20 microns, and does not contain pores but rather a layer of endothelial cells that form vacuoles that allow for drainage of aqueous into the canals of Schlemm. The canals of Schlemm are not considered a part of the trabecular meshwork."

Symptoms of dacryocystitis typically involve pain, redness, and swelling over the medial canthal aspect of the lower eyelid where the lacrimal sac resides. Additionally, patients will also commonly complain of watery eyes or of mucous that may extrude from the punctum upon digital pressure. The mainstay of treatment for cases of dacryocystitis includes oral antibiotics; however, in some patients surgical treatment may be necessary. &#10;&#10;Remember that inflammation of the lacrimal gland, located at the temporal aspect of the upper lid, is known as dacryoadenitis."

      "explanation": "The lacrimal punctum is a small aperture located in the lacrimal papilla, the slight elevation at the junction of the lacrimal and ciliary portions of the eyelid margin. Initially, the tear film drains through this aperture. The lacrimal punctum leads into the lacrimal canaliculus, the tube connecting the punctum to the lacrimal sac. The ampulla is a slight dilation in the initial portion of the lacrimal canaliculus. The canaliculi from the upper and lower lids run horizontally along the lid margin, connecting into a common canaliculus that then enters the lateral aspect of the lacrimal sac located in the anterior portion of the medial orbital wall. The lacrimal sac empties into the nasolacrimal duct in the maxillary bone. The valve of Hasner is located at the terminus of the nasolacrimal duct in the inferior nasal meatus. The Valve of Hasner is a fold of mucosal tissue that ensures that fluid flows anterograde out of the duct. &#10;&#10;Ref: Remington, LA. Clinical Anatomy of the Visual System, 1998 pp 153-154"

The outer surface of the lens plate invaginates to form a lens pit which continues until it forms the lens vesicle. The lens vesicle which separates from the surface ectoderm around day 33; it is a single layer of cells forming a hollow sphere. After the lens vesicle is formed, posterior epithelial cells become the primary lens fibers and form the embryonic lens nucleus at the center of the developing lens. The anterior cells stay in place at this time, and the equatorial cells divide and elongate to form secondary lens fibers around the embryonic nucleus. The lens capsule is apparent at about 5 weeks; it originates from the basement membrane of the surface ectoderm and from secretions of the lens epithelium. &#10;&#10;Ref: Remington, LA.

      "answers": [" Brushfield spots   "],
      "explanation": "Brushfield spots are small whitish or greyish lesions that are typically found circumferentially around the peripheral region of the iris. They represent focal areas of stromal hyperplasia that are surrounded by areas of relative hypoplasia. Brushfield spots are more commonly observed in patients with lightly pigmented irides. This finding can be observed in some normal individuals but has a strong association in patients with Down syndrome. &#10;&#10;Lisch nodules are small hyper-pigmented lesions that are observed in almost all cases of neurofibromatosis-1. Mammilations are also associated with neurofibromatosis (as well as congenital ocular melanocytosis, Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly, and Peters anomaly) and present as tiny conical or vitelliform lesions that either partially or completely cover the anterior surface of the iris. &#10;&#10;Koeppe and Busacca nodules are iris lesions that are associated with granulomatous uveitis; however, their placement differs from one another. Koeppe nodules are observed at the iris pupillary border, in contrast to Busacca nodules, which are found in the mid-iris stroma."

The water begins to pool together creating vacuoles. The pooling of water causes light scattering because the index of refraction differs between that of the lens proteins and the water aggregations. &#10;&#10;Glutathione loss and decreased function of the ion pump do indeed contribute to cataract formation, but the direct cause of vacuoles is pooling of water. &#10;&#10;Loss of capsular elasticity leads to presbyopia."

      "options": [" Low hyperopia  ", " Low myopia  ", " Moderate myopia  ", " Moderate hyperopia   ", " Emmetropia  "],
      "answers": [" Moderate hyperopia   "],
      "explanation": "Patients with moderate to high amounts of hyperopia typically have a shortened axial length of the eye. In these cases, the volume and depth of the anterior chamber is reduced as well as compared to normal eyes (or eyes with myopic refractive errors). This decreased anterior chamber depth puts these patients at higher risk for increased intraocular pressure due to narrow angles that may eventually result in an angle closure attack. Additionally, as a cataract progresses with age, the crystalline lens tends to grow, further shallowing the anterior chamber. Cataract surgery in this population usually results in a deepening of the anterior chamber (usually decreasing the IOP) and also reduces the chances of a future angle closure. It is important to note that this effect may not occur in all cases of moderate to high hyperopia, but this group is the most likely to experience a change in IOP following cataract extraction."

      "answers": [" Higher pH than normal   "],
      "explanation": "The tear film in people with dry eyes displays a higher pH than that of normal eyes. The change in pH is attributable to the fact that the osmolarity of the tears increases, thus increasing the pH. Many drug companies have taken advantage of this knowledge and applied it in their manufacture of artificial tears. Alcon, the company that invented Systane, ultilizes a component called Hydroxypropyl-guar (HP-Guar) which is a gel-forming matrix. Upon instillation of Systane into the eye, the liquid transforms into a gel. The difference in pH between the tear film and the artificial tears leads to an alteration in the cross-linking between HP-Guar and borate (another ingredient in the artificial tears), causing the creation of a gel-like layer that allows for increased ocular contact time. Studies show that the tear lysozyme content is decreased in people who suffer from dry eyes."

      "question": "Your 43 year-old male patient reports a gradual decrease in vision over the past year that tends to worsen when reading or in bright lighting conditions.

      "options": [" Mature cataract  ", " Posterior subcapsular cataract  ", " Cortical cataract  ", " Nuclear sclerotic cataract  "],
      "answers": [" Posterior subcapsular cataract  "],
      "explanation": "Posterior subcapsular cataracts occur just in front of the posterior capsule and typically present as a granulated or vacuolated opacity that can be best viewed with an obliquely oriented parallel-piped light beam on slit-lamp biomicroscopy. On retroillumination, this type of cataract appears as a black plaque located deep within the lens (it has the same appearance on retinoscopy). Patients presenting with this type of cataract commonly complain of decreased vision, even in mild cases, due to the location of the opacities occurring at the nodal point of the eye. Near vision and vision under bright light conditions are typically the most affected due to miosis that occurs in these situations. Posterior subcapsular cataracts have a strong association with long-term use of systemic or topical corticosteroids. &#10;&#10;Cortical cataracts typically present as wedge-shaped or radial spoke-like opacities that can occur in the anterior, posterior, or equatorial cortex of the crystalline lens. These patients more commonly complain of problems with glare due to the scattering of light from these opacities. &#10;&#10;A nuclear sclerotic cataract is characterized by an early yellowing of the crystalline lens nucleus due to the deposition of urochrome pigment and eventually appears brownish in color in later stages. It is best viewed with an oblique light beam on slit-lamp evaluation as compared to retroillumination. &#10;&#10;A mature cataract is a completely opacified crystalline lens that commonly appears white in color."

      "explanation": "Ptosis is a condition in which the upper eyelid sags. It can be caused by dysfunction of either the superior palpebral levator or the superior tarsal muscle (muscle of Muller). Because the levator is the major muscle responsible for raising the upper eyelid, ptosis from levator damage is often more severe then ptosis from dysfunction of the muscle of Muller. &#10;&#10;The muscle of Horner (also known as the pars lacrimalis) is part of the palpebral portion of the orbicularis oculi.

Patients commonly complain of a mild non-specific irritation but no pain. Visual acuity is also not usually affected in these patients. Scleromalacia perforans typically affects elderly women with a long-standing history of rheumatoid arthritis. By the time patients are correctly diagnosed with this condition, treatment is usually not needed or is ineffective.

      "explanation": "Several features of the presentation of nodular episcleritis can be utilized to aid in differentiating this condition from conjunctival lesions (such as a phlyctenule) and a nodule associated with scleritis. Typically, in nodular episcleritis, there is an area of localized inflammation that forms a round or oval nodule that is commonly 2-6mm in size. Any associated episcleral blood vessel congestion is usually minimal and will blanch, along with the conjunctival vessels, with the instillation of phenylephrine drops. Scleral blood vessels will not blanch; therefore, if congestion is still present, the inflammation is affecting the sclera. Additionally, nodules related to episcleritis are not usually tender to touch, as they are in cases of nodular scleritis. Also, light mechanical pressure in the region of the nodule can help localize the lesion, as the conjunctival tissue will freely move over the nodule, and the nodule will freely move over the sclera in patients with nodular episcleritis. Conjunctival lesions will move with the conjunctival tissue when pressure is applied, while a nodule associated with scleritis is completely immobile.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Scleritis"

      ],
      "answers": [" The sclera is considered avascular; it contains no capillary beds   "],
      "explanation": "The sclera is considered an avascular tissue due to the fact that it does not contain any capillary beds. The sclera is a very low metabolically active tissue, and it obtains sufficient nutrition through the overlying episcleral and underlying choroidal blood supplies. In contrast, the episclera obtains a rich supply of blood from both the anterior ciliary arteries and posterior ciliary arteries, which form a superficial vascular plexus and deep vascular plexus within its tissue. An episode of episcleritis is characterized by vasculitis of the superficial vascular plexus and edema of the episclera, while scleritis involves vasculitis of the deep episcleral vascular plexus and edema of the scleral tissue. Episcleritis occurs in the absence of scleritis; however, scleritis typically occurs in conjunction with episcleritis (but can also be isolated). &#10;&#10;Clinical Ocular Pharmacology.

      "explanation": "The most common late complication (of uncomplicated cataract surgery) is visually significant posterior capsular opacification. This finding commonly causes complaints of decreased vision, impaired contrast sensitivity, glare, and in some cases, monocular diplopia. Elschnig pearls are a typical finding that appear as vacuolated clusters on the back surface of the lens implant. They are a result of migration and proliferation of residual equatorial lens epithelial cells along the posterior capsule. In addition to Elschnig pearls, capsular fibrosis is another common finding of posterior capsular opacification that is due to fibrous metaplasia of epithelial cells. It is less common than Elschnig pearls but usually appears earlier. &#10;&#10;Posterior subcapsular cataracts and posterior polar cataracts only occur in the natural crystalline lens. &#10;&#10;Anterior capsular contraction is a post-operative complication that typically occurs several weeks after cataract surgery. Contraction and fibrosis of the anterior capsule can continue to progress and affect visual acuity; this progression may require a laser capsulotomy."

      "explanation": "Posterior subcapsular cataracts (PSC) are the result of cellular migration from the equator to the posterior pole and tend to affect visual acuity to a greater degree than other types of cataracts due to the fact that they are closest to the posterior nodal point of the eye and are located on or near the visual axis. Patients with PSCs will complain of decreased acuity in bright light and to a lesser degree in low light. This asymmetrical disruption of visual acuity in varying light levels stems from changes in pupil size. In bright light the pupils constrict, creating a small aperture that is covered over by the opacification. In low lighting conditions, the pupils dilate allowing for greater lens exposure most of which is not opacified (or at least to a lesser degree) resulting in improved vision."

      "explanation": "The possible formation of posterior subcapsular cataracts (PSC) is a common concern in patients undergoing long-term treatment with corticosteroid therapy. PSCs have been associated with the use of systemic, topical, ophthalmic, topical dermatologic, nasal aerosol, and inhalation type steroids. This relationship is likely dose-dependent, and the usual time from beginning steroid treatment to the onset of lens changes is 1 year (with a dosage of 10 mg/day of prednisone) but has been observed in as short as 2 months with as little as 5 mg/day. Patients with PSC formation may complain of an increase in light sensitivity, photophobia, glare, or difficulty reading. If visual acuity is notably decreased, surgical removal of the lens may be warranted."

If an infection occurs anywhere in the orbit posterior to this septum, it is known as orbital cellulitis. &#10;&#10;An internal hordeolum is a localized infection of the meibomian glands, while an external hordeolum is described as an acute infection with abscess formation of the glands of Zeiss and Moll. A pyogenic granuloma is a proliferative fibrovascular response to prior inflammation, surgery, or trauma."

      "explanation": "A Vossius ring refers to an annular ring of iris pigment that can be seen on the anterior capsule of the crystalline lens. A Vossius ring may be observed following blunt ocular trauma, in which the pupillary edge of the iris is forced against the anterior lens capsule; a concurrent traumatic cataract is also typically found in these cases. A Vossius ring may also occur secondary to posterior synechiae that have formed between the pupillary border and crystalline lens and then broken by mydriasis."

      "answers": [" Procerus   ", " Corrugator   ", " Orbicularis oculi   "],
      "explanation": "The major protractor of the eyelid, responsible for the closure of the lids, is the orbicularis oculi muscle. It is innervated by the facial nerve and can be divided into three portions: preseptal, orbital, and pretarsal. Spontaneous blinking is a result of the action of the pretarsal and preseptal regions, while stimulation of the orbital portion results in forced eyelid closure. &#10;&#10;Corrugators are also considered protractors of the eyelids. They also act to draw the eyebrow downward and medially, causing wrinkles of the forehead. It is for this reason that this muscle is also known as the 'frowning' muscle. &#10;&#10;The procerus also aids in the closure of the eyelids. Additionally, it helps pull the skin between the eyebrows downward and contributes to the expression of anger. &#10;&#10;The frontalis and levator palpebrae superioris muscles are responsible for retraction of the eyelids. &#10;&#10;Ocular Surface Disease: Conjunctiva and Tear Film: Expert Consult.

      "options": [" Proptosis   ", " Normal extra-ocular motility (EOM)  ", " Painful swelling of eyelid tissue  ", " Normal visual acuity  "],
      "answers": [" Proptosis   "],
      "explanation": "Preseptal cellulitis is an infection that is limited to structures that lay anterior to the orbital septum and is most commonly caused by sinusitis. This condition may also arise from a dental infection, internal hordeola or trauma. Common pathogens include Haemophilus influenzae (especially in children) and Staphylococcus and Streptococcus (more likely in adults). Findings of preseptal cellulitis include a unilateral painful, swollen eyelid with potentially mild chemosis. EOMs, visual acuity, pupillary reaction, and fundus findings should be normal. Treatment consists of oral antibiotics and close follow-up to ensure resolution. &#10;&#10;Orbital cellulitis is a very serious infection that has a risk of mortality due to its ability to extend into the meninges and cavernous sinus. Patients with orbital cellulitis will typically feel very ill. Clinical findings may include proptosis, an afferent pupillary defect, diplopia, pain on eye movement, papilledema, decreased visual acuity, reduced color vision, eyelid edema, external ophthalmoplegia, and an increased white blood cell count. Treatment is immediate hospitalization and antibiotic treatment."

      "explanation": "Flare in the anterior chamber refers to presence of an increased amount of protein in the aqueous fluid, and is often seen in association with cells. Aqueous cells and flare occur secondary to the breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier as a result of trauma, infection, inflammation due to uveitis, scleritis, keratitis, or ocular surgery. &#10;&#10;Cells and flare in the anterior chamber may be difficult to appreciate in mild cases and are best observed when viewed what a short, narrow slit-lamp beam, directed at an oblique angle through the pupil. All room lights should be completely turned off and the observer allowed time to dark-adapt. Cells will appear as small white particles floating in the anterior chamber, while flare makes the aqueous fluid appear hazy or cloudy (like smoke in a dark room)."

Punctal stenosis is a narrowing of the puncta, which usually occurs secondarily to usage of pharmacological agents. Dacryocystitis refers to an inflammation of the lacrimal sac (generally secondary to an infection). Canaliculitis is caused by inflammation of the canaliculus (usually as a result of infection)."

      "question": "An 81-year old female reports that her eye has been watering more frequently over the past month; you decide to administer the primary Jones dye test (Jones I). After 5 minutes, the application of a cotton-tipped applicator to the inferior turbinate reveals the presence of dye in the area. Taking this into consideration, what is the MOST likely cause of the patient's epiphora complaint?",
      "options": [" Punctal stenosis  ", " Complete nasolacrimal duct obstruction  ", " Dysfunction of the valve of Hasner  ", " Partial nasolacrimal duct obstruction  ", " Hypersecretion of tears   "],
      "answers": [" Hypersecretion of tears   "],
      "explanation": "The primary Jones dye test can be utilized to determine the patency of the nasolacrimal system. 1-2 drops of fluorescein are instilled into the inferior fornix of the eyes while the patient is in an upright position and blinking her eyes normally. After a period of 5 to 10 minutes, a cotton-tipped applicator is used to swab the undersurface of the inferior turbinate on each side of the nasal passage. &#10;&#10;When the primary Jones dye test is positive (dye is recovered from the inferior turbinate of the nose), practitioners may conclude that the system is patent and that no significant blockage of the nasolacrimal drainage structure is likely. However, minor stenosis or physiologic dysfunctions cannot be completely ruled out. Patients who have a positive result on the Jones I test are more likely to experience symptoms of epiphora that are secondary to primary oversecretion of tears, rather than a dysfunction in lacrimal drainage (as in the above question). &#10;&#10;When the primary Jones dye test is negative, the probability of an obstruction or dysfunction in lacrimal drainage is much greater; however, this test alone is not sufficient to document this conclusion. The secondary Jones dye test is then necessary to determine the severity and location of the obstruction."

      "question": "During case history, your patient reveals that he is concerned about a lesion on his left lower eyelid. He states that it grew very rapidly at first, then has remained static for the past 2 months. Upon examination you notice that the lesion has a keratin-filled crater centrally. Which of the following is the MOST likely diagnosis of the patient's chief complaint?",

      "answers": [" Keratoacanthoma   "],
      "explanation": "Keratoacanthoma is a rapidly growing tumor that typically occurs in patients with fair skin and a history of chronic sun exposure. It may have a similar appearance to that of a squamous cell carcinoma; however, the following stages and characteristics may aid in correctly diagnosing this type of lesion: &#10;- Very rapidly growing lesion, typically pink in color initially and often found on the lower eyelid &#10;- The lesion usually stops growing and remains stable in size for a period of 2-3 months &#10;- After this time, the lesion starts to involute spontaneously (this phenomenon is very helpful in diagnosing keratoacanthoma) &#10;- During this period of involution, the central part of the lesion becomes hyperkeratotic, and a keratin-filled crater commonly develops &#10;- Involution may take up to a year and a residual scar in the area of the lesion typically occurs after involution is complete &#10;&#10;Actinic keratosis is a slow-growing lesion that typically occurs on the forehead and back of hands (rarely on the eyelids). It presents as a hyperkeratotic plaque, with a scaly surface, and distinct borders. This condition is a precursor to squamous cell carcinoma. &#10;&#10;A pyogenic granuloma is a rapidly growing vascular lesion that tends to be painful and commonly bleeds with minor trauma. It is usually preceded by a history surgery, trauma, or infection. &#10;&#10;Chalazia form as a result of retained sebaceous secretions from the meibomian glands (or other sebaceous glands). A chalazion presents as a non-tender, roundish nodule at the region of the tarsal plate. &#10;&#10;Squamous cell papillomas can have variable appearances, such as a flesh-colored pedunculated lesion, a broad-based raspberry-like lesion, or a cutaneous horn-like presentation."

      "question": "Numerous reports have suggested that increased tear film osmolarity is a key consequence in dry eye. Although osmolarity is not easily measured in the clinical setting, tear osmolarity increases in most dry eye sub-types due to which of the following processes?",
      "options": [
        " Reactive oxygen species are increased in the tears of most dry eye sub-types; this increases osmolarity  ",
        " Patients with dry eye tend to blink less than normals, leading to increased evaporation  ",

      ],
      "answers": [" Loss of tear stability induces an increased evaporation rate, leading to increased osmolarity   "],
      "explanation": "Tear instability leads to greater evaporation and higher osmolarity through a mechanism of concentration of the remaining tears, since only the aqueous tear portion evaporates rather than the ionic species. Several studies have indicated that normal tear osmolarity is less than or equal to 300 Osm/L, with values exceeding 308 Osm/L indicating increased osmolarity. As a single measure, tear osmolarity has recently been found to correlate the best (r squared 0.55) to dry eye severity of several clinical tests in a large, multi-center study (Sullivan et al., IOVS 51:6125-6130, 2010)."

      ],
      "answers": [" Reduced active secretion of aqueous by the ciliary epithelium   "],
      "explanation": "In acute phases of anterior uveitis, intraocular pressure is initially decreased secondary to a reduction of active aqueous production by the ciliary epithelium. This finding is due to the ciliary body essentially 'shutting down' in response to inflammation. In later stages or in more severe cases of intraocular inflammation, IOP can be elevated due to blockage of the trabecular meshwork by inflammatory cells. &#10;&#10;In cases of herpetic uveitis and Posner-Schlossman syndrome, intraocular pressure can actually be elevated, but these conditions occur with much less frequency than acute anterior uveitis."

      "explanation": "In order to calculate the necessary power of the intraocular lens implant to be utilized during cataract surgery, there are critical measurements that must be made prior to the procedure. This ensures that the patient's outcome will most closely match the desired post-operative refractive values. These measurements include corneal keratometry as well as the antero-posterior dimension of the eye (axial length). These values are most important due to the fact that the overall power of the eye is essentially dependent on corneal curvature and the lens, with the location of the retina as the image plane. &#10;&#10;Other measurements are often made with newer technological advances to better calculate the power of the intraocular lens. These include the anterior chamber depth and corneal white-to-white diameter."

      ],
      "answers": [" Hardening of the lenticular nucleus potentially increasing the difficulty of cataract extraction   "],
      "explanation": "The desire to delay cataract surgery is a common occurrence. Ultimately, if the patient is asymptomatic, visual acuity remains fairly good, and their activities of daily living are not affected, the patient may choose to postpone surgery. The potential complications of delaying surgery must be discussed with the patient before reaching a decision. A 'soft' cataract is easier to remove than a 'hard' cataract. The longer a cataract is left in the eye, the harder the lens will become, making it more difficult to break apart and separate from the posterior capsular bag. Additionally, a younger patient will heal faster and more readily than a person who is of advanced age. A cataract does not cause damage to retinal structures or the optic nerve, nor can it cause amblyopia in this patient, as he is no longer considered to be in the critical period of development."

      "explanation": "Incomplete closure of the eyelids is known as lagophthalmos. Complete closure of the lids is imperative in maintaining a proper tear film and promoting an adequately moist environment for the corneal surface. Additionally, the resurfacing of tears during blinking flushes away possible irritants, bacteria, and foreign bodies. If this process is impaired by incomplete closure of the lids, the eye can suffer from drying, infections, and ulceration. &#10;&#10;Some patients may experience this condition at night while sleeping; this is known as nocturnal lagophthalmos. Typically, when lids are closed during sleep, Bell's phenomenon occurs (eyes roll back), which protects the surface of the cornea; however, if Bell's phenomenon is poor, these patients may also experience symptoms of exposure keratopathy."

She was diagnosed with iritis 1 week ago and is currently being managed with Pred Forte® topical eye drops every 2 hours. She reports no change in her symptomology and is still very photophobic, and her eye still bothers her. Slit lamp evaluation reveals no change in her clinical signs. Which of the following conditions may be the underlying cause of a non-responsive iritis?",
      "options": [" Rheumatoid arthritis  ", " Tuberculosis  ", " An intraocular tumor   ", " Behcet's syndrome  "],
      "answers": [" An intraocular tumor   "],
      "explanation": "Patients, especially the elderly, may exhibit a non-responsive iritis, which is caused by an intraocular tumor, leukemia, metastatic cancer, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Therefore, if a patient is being treated for iritis and the condition is not responding to conventional topical therapeutic treatment, further evaluation is warranted. &#10;&#10;Patients with iritis, also known as anterior uveitis, typically will report photophobia, excessive lacrimation, pain, and diminished visual acuity. This condition is caused by either inflammation of the iris or of both the iris and the anterior portion of the ciliary body (iridocyclitis). Clinical signs include: keratic precipitates (which are variable in size and distribution, depending upon the etiology of the iritis) deposited on the corneal endothelium, cells and flare (protein that has leaked from iris vessels into the anterior chamber), sluggish and slightly constricted pupils caused by swelling of the uveal tract, irregular pupil margins (if posterior synechiae are present), and in the event of granulomatous inflammation, iris nodules. An acute episode of anterior uveitis or chronic uveitis may cause the formation of posterior synechiae. Cells may also be present in the vitreal chamber; however, the number of cells in the anterior chamber should exceed the number seen in the vitreous cavity. Treatment of iritis includes a cycloplegic agent to help prevent formation or promote breakdown of synechiae. A cycloplegic also aids in pain management by controlling pupil size and avoiding unnecessary movement of the iris muscles, which can be very painful with this inflammatory condition. UV protection (tinted lenses) is also helpful in management of the associated photophobia. A topical steroid is prescribed to reduce the inflammatory response. It is very important to slowly taper the use of the steroid; otherwise there is a risk of rebound inflammation. &#10;&#10;Although rheumatoid arthritis, Behcet's syndrome, and tuberculosis can lead to the development of an iritis, this associated iritis can typically be managed via traditional methods such as topical steroid and cycloplegic drops. &#10;&#10;Review of Optometry.

      "answers": [" Rosacea   "],
      "explanation": "Rosacea is a condition that causes excessive blushing of the face, with or without ocular involvement. Rhinophyma (a large, bulbous, red nose) is common in rosacea. Patients will often complain of facial flushing that is exacerbated with extreme temperature exposure, exertion, or the ingestion of hot beverages. This condition is seen two times more frequently in women. Ocular implications commonly include blepharitis, meibomitis, telangiectasia, dry eye syndrome, and occasional corneal involvement such as superficial punctate keratitis, pannus, and neovascularization. Treatment of facial rosacea includes oral tetracycline, topical metronidazole and retinoid compounds. Ocular rosacea is best treated by managing concomitant lid diseases along with artificial tears. While a hordeola and dry eye syndrome do occur in rosacea, these should not be your primary diagnoses. Remember to look at the overall broad picture and not just the pair of eyeballs. &#10;&#10;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that has the capability of affecting many areas of the body. A common finding of SLE is called the malar (or butterfly) rash that is seen in roughly half of the individuals affected by this disorder. This rash generally occurs on the cheeks and over the nose bridge and worsens with ultraviolet light exposure. Concurrent eye conditions with SLE are primarily secondary to complications from the medications used to manage the condition such as oral corticosteroids and anti-malarials."

      "question": "Which of the following regions of the sclera is the weakest and most likely to cup outward when there is increased intraocular pressure (i.e. glaucoma)?",
      "options": [" Scleral spur  ", " Palisades of Vogt  ", " Lamina cribrosa   ", " Limbus  "],
      "answers": [" Lamina cribrosa   "],
      "explanation": "The lamina cribrosa is the posterior scleral foramen through which the optic nerve passes. It is a sieve-like structure with interwoven collagen fibrils forming canals allowing optic nerve fibers to pass. It is the weakest area of the outer connective tissue tunic which is why cupping out or ectasia may be seen as a sign of increased intraocular pressure. The scleral spur is a region of circularly oriented collagen bundles which serves as the origin of the longitudinal ciliary muscle fibers. The limbus is the band located at the junction of the cornea and sclera. Here, there is a transition from squamous corneal epithelium to columnar conjunctival epithelium, as well as a transition from the very regular corneal stroma to the irregular scleral stroma, and the termination of Bowman's layer, Descemet's membrane and the corneal endothelium. The palisades of Vogt are radial projections of the limbal epithelium that extend into the cornea; it is an area where corneal epithelial stem cells reside. &#10;&#10;Ref: Remington, LA.

      "question": "What is the MOST frequently encountered type of anterior scleritis?",
      "options": [" Scleromalacia perforans  ", " Necrotizing  ", " Nodular  ", " Diffuse   "],
      "answers": [" Diffuse   "],
      "explanation": "Scleritis is an inflammation of the sclera that generally occurs secondarily to a systemic condition, usually of collagen vascular origin. Diffuse scleritis has a gradual onset and presents as a boring pain which may radiate to other structures such as the jaw and forehead. Patients will present with distension of the scleral vascular pattern, causing a deep pinkish hue of the sclera. Nodular scleritis appears similar to diffuse scleritis, but the areas of inflammation are localized to painful, raised nodules. Scleromalacia perforans is the least common form and is almost always seen in association with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients with scleromalacia perforans generally do not experience pain or inflammation. Necrotizing scleritis is the most severe form and has a higher mortality rate than the other types due to the fact that it usually stems from autoimmune diseases. &#10;&#10;References: Schwartz, G.

      "options": [" Secretion of lysozymes  ", " Mechanical protection   ", " Optical   ", " Facilitation of corneal metabolism   ", " Primary refractive component of the eye  ", " Reduction of visual stimuli   "],
      "answers": [" Mechanical protection   ", " Optical   ", " Facilitation of corneal metabolism   ", " Reduction of visual stimuli   "],
      "explanation": "The tarsals serve many functions. The eyelids protect against damage from foreign objects (as do the eyelashes). Eyelids also help to maintain a moist environment for the cornea enabling a regular surface and better optics. In addition to reducing visual stimuli (we can only process so much at one time), eyelids aid in corneal metabolism. Blinking helps to redistribute tears, allowing for diffusion of oxygen into the cornea and removing wastes, like carbon dioxide. The palpebrae are NOT the primary refractive component of the eyes; this role is assigned to the cornea, nor do they secrete lysozymes. Lysozymes are found in the tear film and help to protect the eye as they possess antibacterial properties."

      "explanation": "Spastic entropion results from over stimulation of the palpebral segment of the orbicularis and is generally caused by blepharospasm due to inflammation, irritation, or injury. This type of entropion cannot be repaired via surgery. It does, however, respond well to Botox injections. &#10;&#10;Congenital entropion generally arises from a malformation of the tarsal plate and is well managed with surgery. &#10;&#10;Atonic, involutional, and senile entropion are synonymous and are caused by an increased lid laxity and a decreased tonus of the lid (usually the lower lid). This type of entropion is seen in the elderly and responds very well to surgery."

      "answers": [" Long posterior ciliary arteries   ", " Anterior ciliary arteries   "],
      "explanation": "The arterial blood supply to the anterior segment of the eye comes from the anterior ciliary arteries (ACAs), as well as the terminal branches of the long posterior ciliary arteries (LPCAs). &#10;&#10;The LPCAs arise from branches of the ophthalmic artery. They pierce the posterior aspect of the sclera and run anteriorly along either side of the eye, between the sclera and the choroid. The ACAs are derived from branches of the ophthalmic artery and run anteriorly with the extraocular muscles. They pierce the sclera near the area of the cornea. The LPCAs and ACAs together form two sagittal arterial circles and two coronal arterial circles, called the episcleral arterial circle superficially and the greater circle of the iris deeply. The physiology of the arterial flow in this region ensures that the anterior segment of the eye is always supplied with an adequate supply of blood. &#10;&#10;Adler's Physiology of the Eye.

      "question": "Which of the following skin conditions is considered to be benign and has the LOWEST risk of malignancy?",
      "options": [" Squamous cell carcinoma  ", " Actinic keratosis  ", " Keratoacanthoma   ", " Basal cell carcinoma  "],
      "answers": [" Keratoacanthoma   "],
      "explanation": "Keratoacanthoma appears very much like squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in that it tends to progress rapidly and appears to ulcerate. This condition typically occurs in middle-aged and elderly patients of Caucasian descent on areas of the skin that are exposed. The lesion appears elevated, and eventually the center will produce a scab-like plug of keratin. The margins surrounding the plug will be rolled. At some point the keratin plug will fall out, resulting in the formation of a pit, and the lesion will regress. Most patients and clinicians do not like to wait this condition out due to its similarities to SCC. &#10;&#10;Actinic keratosis is a pre-cursor to squamous cell carcinoma and appears as scaly, dry skin that does not heal. People with skin that is of lighter pigmentation along with excessive exposure to ultraviolet light tend to be most at risk for development of this condition. &#10;&#10;Squamous cell carcinoma (SSC) is thankfully one of the rarest malignancies but due to its ability to metastasize can be quite dangerous. This malignancy has the ability to progress rapidly and has a high affinity for people who spend a lot of time in the sun, especially those who are light-skinned. The only way to definitively diagnose SCC is to refer for a biopsy and ensuring the use of Mohs technique. This strategy takes more time but ensures that the lesion is removed. Essentially, Mohs procedure calls for removal of tissue and biopsy of the surrounding borders. If the borders prove to be malignant then more tissue is removed and biopsied. This continues until the borders prove to be free of any carcinoma. &#10;&#10;Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common malignant lid lesion and mercifully tends to be very slow-growing. BCC generally appears as a waxy, translucent nodule. Eventually the nodule will ulcerate. Patients may bring these to your attention and tell you that they have 'had it for years and it just does not seem to heal'. Whenever you hear this it is best to send out for biopsy via Mohs technique. BCC very rarely metastasizes."

      "question": "Your 67 year-old Asian female patient returns to your office for the third time in the past year with a bump in the same location on her left upper eyelid. You had previously diagnosed her with a chalazion; however, due to its recurrent nature, you send her out for a tissue biopsy. Which of the following eyelid lesion are you MOST concerned about?",
      "options": [" Squamous cell carcinoma  ", " Malignant melanoma  ", " Keratoacanthoma  ", " Sebaceous cell carcinoma   ", " Basal cell carcinoma  "],
      "answers": [" Sebaceous cell carcinoma   "],
      "explanation": "Sebaceous cell carcinoma of the eyelid often masquerades as a recurrent chalazion; therefore, it is very important to send patients out for tissue biopsies in cases of recurrent lesions. It is also for this reason that sebaceous cell carcinomas are one of the most dangerous eyelid tumors because correct diagnosis tends to be delayed until the tumor has metastasized. &#10;&#10;This type of tumor is more common in Asian populations as compared to other races. In most cases, female patients outnumber males, and the mean age at diagnosis is in the mid-60s. Sebaceous cell carcinoma also tends to show a predilection for the upper eyelid (unlike basal cell carcinoma). It typically presents as a focal mass (pseudochalazion), but can also appear as a multi-centric tumor, or a diffuse lesion. It also does not usually ulcerate, as do basal and squamous cell carcinomatous lesions."

      ],
      "answers": [" Swelling of the crystalline lens, leading to changes in its refractive index "],
      "explanation": "In addition to causing cataracts, patients with diabetes mellitus can experience changes in the crystalline lens, which results in an alteration of its refractive index as well as its amplitude of accommodation. Elevated blood glucose levels cause an increase in the concentration of glucose present in the aqueous humor, which can then diffuse into the crystalline lens. In the lens, glucose is metabolized to sorbitol (by aldose reductase), which subsequently accumulates within the lens. This leads to an influx of water into the lens from an osmotic imbalance, causing overhydration of the lens substance, which alters the refractive index of the crystalline lens. Therefore, with patients in whom there is a continuous large fluctuation in blood glucose levels, the lens also constantly changes in response to glycemic level changes, resulting in a variation in the refractive error. Patients will complain that the glasses Rx seems to be incorrect or that their vision constantly changes; this is most commonly due to these lens changes. Most doctors defer prescribing glasses until the patient can maintain a more consistent glycemic value."

      "answers": [" Euryblepharon   "],
      "explanation": "Euryblepharon is the result of an enlarged horizontal palpebral fissure that causes partial lateral ectropion or poor lateral apposition of the eyelid to the globe. This finding may occur in conjunction with strabismus, a double row of meibomian glands, or telecanthus. Severe cases of euryblepharon may result in exposure keratopathy. &#10;&#10;Symblepharon is a partial or complete adhesion between the palpebral conjunctiva of the eyelid (usually the lower lid) to the bulbar conjunctiva of the globe. &#10;&#10;Ankyloblepharon refers to partial adhesion of the eyelids to each other or complete fusion occurring secondary to injury, infection (Trachoma), or tarsorrhaphy. Ankyloblepharon causes a reduction of the palpebral aperture. This condition can also be congenital, in which case the condition is known as ankyloblepharon filiforme adenatum. &#10;&#10;Blepharophimosis describes a condition in which the lateral and medial canthi are fused together, resulting in a narrowing of the palpebral fissure.

The Schirmer I without anesthesia essentially becomes a stress test since it is so irritating; if the patient cannot produce aqueous tears under irritating conditions, the main lacrimal gland is probably compromised. Conversely, meibomian gland dropout can be observed in both aqueous tear deficiency and MGD, possibly due to inflammatory processes on the ocular surface."

      "options": [" Telecanthus  ", " Epicanthus  ", " Ectropion   ", " Entropion  ", " Madarosis  "],
      "answers": [" Ectropion   "],
      "explanation": "Ectropion means an eversion of the eyelid margin. When the lid margin is no longer in contact with the globe, this can lead to poor tear drainage and overflow (epiphora). Ectropion most commonly occurs due to loss of muscle tone with aging. Entropion is an inversion of the lid margin that can place the eyelashes in contact with the globe and lead to abrasion. Entropion can occur from spasm of the orbicularis oculi muscle or from scarring of the eyelid. Both entropion and ectropion occur more commonly in the lower eyelid than the upper eyelid. Telecanthus is a term that describes increased distance between the eyelids at the medial canthus. Epicanthus is a synonym for the orbital fold or Mongolian fold of the eyelid. Madarosis is a term that describes loss of the eyelashes (ciliary madarosis) or the eyebrows (superciliary madarosis). &#10;&#10;Ref: Remington, LA.

      "explanation": "The crystalline lens is composed of proteins arranged in anti-parallel beta sheets. Crystallin protein is highly water-soluble and is the primary protein located within the lens. Crystallin is important in lens clarity. Oxidative damage, such as that from UV light, causes the formation of sulfide bonds between methionine groups and cysteine side chains (both of these amino acids contain sulfur). The sulfide bonds cause high molecular weight aggregates that precipitate as they lose their water solubility. The precipitates are opaque, causing reduced lens clarity. Glutathione is a powerful reductant produced by the body. It is implicated in the protection against oxidative damage by free radicals. Glutathione breaks the disulfide bonds, restoring proper protein configuration.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Crystalline Lens"

      "explanation": "The only structure of the eye that is isolated from the immune system is the lens. This is due to the fact that the lens is completely avascular and derives all of its nutritional needs from the aqueous humor. Because the lens is contained within a capsule, the body is never exposed to its protein contents and therefore if the proteins do become exposed, such as in a hypermature cataract or a dropped nucleus during cataract surgery, the body surmounts an immune reaction because it will not recognize the proteins."

      "answers": [" The cornea   "],
      "explanation": "The cornea absorbs the majority of UV C when the eye is exposed to this very short wavelength of light. Because UV C is a short wavelength, it is also very high energy and therefore prolonged exposure can lead to solar keratitis. The crystalline lens absorbs the majority of UV A and UV B, protecting the retina from potential UV damage. However, over time, the lens may become impaired and result in the formation of a cataract. For the above reasons, it is essential to always recommend good UV protection for your patients. It is also noteworthy that although longer wavelengths tend be less damaging, over exposure to near-infrared wavelengths can result in a 'glass blower's cataract'."

      ],
      "answers": [" The crystalline lens has a lower index of refraction near its edge as compared the index of refraction at its center  "],
      "explanation": "Spherical aberration occurs when parallel light rays that are incident on an optical refracting element towards the edge of the lens are bent more than those light rays that travel through the system closer to the center of the lens. This creates a smeared focal point because the peripheral light rays focus at a point in front of the main image. There are a few ways in which the human eye tries to offset this type of aberration. With respect to the cornea, this surface is an aspherical optical element, in which the periphery of the cornea is flatter than the center of the cornea, thereby weakening the focusing power of the peripheral cornea in an attempt to reduce the amount of spherical aberration present. The crystalline lens is also vulnerable to spherical aberration; however, this refracting component has taken a different approach to control the aberration. Instead of relying on just the varying the curvature of its surface, the lens also varies its index of refraction. The index of refraction of the edge of the lens is lower (and therefore less powerful) than the index of refraction at its center. This is the lens's way of attempting to self-correct spherical aberration inherent within itself. A smaller pupil size is another way that the eye acts to reduce the spherical aberration intrinsic in the crystalline lens."

This conduit does not actually possess any identifiable channels or vessels. Instead, aqueous seeps through the ciliary body and its surrounding tissues like the sclera, eventually draining into the choroidal vessels and as some studies indicate also the lymphatic system."

      "explanation": "Contraction of the ciliary muscle decreases the diameter of the ring formed by the ciliary body. This releases tension on zonule fibers and allows the lens capsule to become more spherical. The anterior surface curve increases and the lens becomes thicker. This increases refractive power (a.k.a. accommodation) and brings near objects into focus on the retina. Another school of thought believes that ciliary body contraction causes an increase in the vitreal mass which causes the vitreous to push the lens forward allowing for clearer near acuity.

      "answers": [" The anterior epithelium   "],
      "explanation": "The anterior epithelium is responsible for all lens growth. This layer is a single cell thick and is located beneath the capsule of the anterior portion of the lens. The anterior epithelium is divided into three different zones based upon mitotic activity and metabolic needs: central, intermediate and equatorial. The cells in the central portion of the lens are cuboidal in shape and possess a slow mitotic rate. Moving towards the equator, the cells begin to elongate and increase their mitotic activity. The cells at the equatorial zone have the highest mitotic rate and are the most elongated. As the cells move inferiorly, they begin to lose their nuclei while they elongate and become lens fibers. The lens fibers are produced all throughout life, with the older fibers being pushed towards the center of the lens. &#10;&#10;The lens capsule is essentially a clear bag that contains the lens. The capsule is produced by the anterior epithelium and the superficial fiber cells of the posterior lens. &#10;&#10;The lens nucleus is divided into several sections. The center of the lens is known as the embryonic nucleus and can be seen as a sutureless round ball of lens fibers. This is surrounded by the fetal nucleus which is demarcated by two Y sutures, one of which is inverted posteriorly. The outermost layer is comprised of the adult nucleus which grows throughout life. The adult nucleus is surrounded by the cortex."

      "answers": [" Uniformity of color within the lesion   "],
      "explanation": "When evaluating a suspicious nevus of the skin surrounding the eye, it is important to remember your 'ABCDEs'. A=asymmetry, B=borders, C=color, D=diameter, E=evolution. A benign nevus tends to be symmetrical such that one can almost fold it in half and the sides would be evenly matched. The borders of a benign nevus are typically regular and distinct. The uniformity of the color should be assessed, rather than the actual level of pigmentation; evenness of pigmentation indicates stability. In general, the diameter of a benign nevus does not exceed 6 mm; although this is obviously not true all of the time, some small nevi may be malignant, and some large nevi (i.e., greater than 6 mm) can be benign. Lastly, most benign nevi tend to be rather flat (as opposed to elevated) with no change or evolution over time. Generally, hair growing out of the lesion is a positive sign, as this indicates that the hair follicle is intact. A cancerous lesion tends to kill the follicle; in this case, hair will no longer sprout. Remember, nevi should be stable and not change in shape, color, or size. ANY change in the nevus warrants a biopsy. Photo documentation is key when following a nevus or with any suspicious lesion."

      "question": "A common cause of epiphora in infants is caused by a small membrane that covers over which of the following structures?",
      "options": [" The puncta  ", " The valve of Hasner   ", " The canaliculus  ", " The lacrimal gland  "],
      "answers": [" The valve of Hasner   "],
      "explanation": "It is common for mothers of young infants to note that one eye (or both eyes) of her infant constantly tears in conjunction with the presence of mucopurulent discharge. This epiphora results from a blockage of the nasolacrimal passageway caused by a membrane covering the valve of Hasner. The majority of blockages will self-resolve without intervention (80-90% of infants) within the first 12 months of life. Treatment may include massage of the nasolacrimal sac several times a day in an effort to rupture the membrane. &#10;&#10;Reference: Chern, K. and Wright K., Review Questions in Ophthalmology: A Question and Answer Book (2005) pp 241"

      "question": "Dacryoadenitis refers to an inflammation or infection of which of the following ocular structures?",
      "options": [" The puncta  ", " The lacrimal sac  ", " The nasolacrimal sac  ", " The lacrimal gland   "],
      "answers": [" The lacrimal gland   "],
      "explanation": "Dacryoadenitis describes inflammation of the lacrimal gland, generally due to infection. The swelling is categorized as either chronic or acute. Acute presentations appear more commonly as a unilateral swelling of the upper eyelid, along with pain, excessive lacrimation, probable ipsilateral lymphadenopathy, and potential proptosis. If the condition is bilateral it is likely due to a systemic infection. Chronic dacryoadenitis is generally bilateral and presents with hard masses that are palpable at the location of the lacrimal gland. This form is often painless and caused by inflammatory diseases such as Grave's, Sjogren's, or sarcoidosis. The chronic type warrants further investigation in order to rule out a lacrimal gland tumor."

      ],
      "answers": [" The upper lid normally rests about 2mm lower than the upper limbus, and the lower lid rests about 1mm above the lower limbus  "],
      "explanation": "The palpebral fissure height is a measurement of the distance between the upper and lower eyelid margins when the patient is looking in primary gaze. This particular measurement is typically less in males (7-10mm) as compared to females (8-12mm). The normal positioning of the upper and lower eyelids are as follows: the upper eyelid usually rests about 2mm below the superior limbus, while the lower eyelid position is typically 1mm above the lower limbus. A unilateral ptosis can be quantified by comparing these measurements to the contralateral eye. A ptosis up to 2mm may be graded as mild; a 3mm ptosis is considered moderate; a ptosis of 4mm or more is deemed severe. &#10;&#10;Another important measurement in evaluating a ptosis is the marginal-reflex distance (MRD). The MRD can be defined as the distance between the upper eyelid margin and the resultant corneal reflection caused by directing a patient's gaze at a penlight held by the examiner. This measurement is normally 4-4.5mm."

      "question": "Your patient reports constant epiphora of the right eye. You wish to determine if there is a blockage of her tear drainage system. You perform lacrimal irrigation. During the procedure, the plunger of the cannula is depressed with great difficulty, and the fluid is regurgitated through the puncta that you are irrigating. What is the CORRECT interpretation of these findings?",
      "options": [
        " There is a blockage that is distal to the common caniculus  ",

      ],
      "answers": [" There is a blockage that is proximal to the common caniculus   "],
      "explanation": "Lacrimal irrigation is performed when an obstruction of the tear drainage system is suspected. Dilation of the puncta generally precedes irrigation. Once the puncta is anesthetized and dilated, a cannula is inserted and saline is injected. If the patient reports that they taste saline, or if they cough because of the fluid in their throat, the drainage system is considered open. If the saline is released by the opposite puncta, then there is a blockage located distally to the common caniculus. If the plunger cannot be depressed, or the fluid is expressed by the same puncta that is being irrigated, then the obstruction is proximal to the common caniculus."

      "question": "A 53-year old male complains of pain, irritation, watering, and foreign body sensation of the left eye. Upon slit lamp examination, you notice several eyelashes emanating from the meibomian glands that are turned inward toward the globe. What is this condition known as?",
      "options": [" Trichiasis  ", " Distichiasis   ", " Meibomian gland dysfunction  ", " Madarosis  ", " Trichotillomania  "],
      "answers": [" Distichiasis   "],
      "explanation": "Distichiasis is a condition of the eyelids in which eyelashes originating from a position posterior to the normal row of lashes grow inward toward the eye. Typically, these lashes emanate from the meibomian gland orifices and may consist of an entire extra row of cilia, or may be focal with only a few abnormal lashes. Distichiasis may be congenital or can be acquired secondary to chronic eyelid inflammatory conditions, surgery, or when an eyelid tumor is present. There is no evidence of entropion in these cases. &#10;&#10;Trichiasis occurs when eyelashes originating from a normal position grow inward toward the globe. Again, there is no entropion of the eyelid margin. This condition can occur after eyelid trauma, surgery, chronic blepharoconjunctivitis, cicatricial pemphigoid, trachoma, or may also be idiopathic. &#10;&#10;Madarosis is a loss of lashes, usually due to either a congenital condition or as a result of an infectious condition. Trichotillomania occurs secondary to a compulsive urge to pull out one's own hair and/or eyelashes."

      "answers": [" Type IV   "],
      "explanation": "Contact dermatitis is an inflammatory response that typically occurs following exposure to metals, cosmetics, medications, or preservatives. During the initial contact with an allergen, the individual is sensitized and develops an immune response if exposure occurs again. This type of reaction is characteristic of a delayed type IV hypersensitivity response and is mediated by T lymphocytes. &#10;&#10;Type I reactions are IgE-mediated reactions that result in an immediate response occurring within minutes of exposure. This type of reaction is seen in allergic disease. Type II reactions are antibody-dependent cytotoxic reactions that are mediated by IgM/IgG and complement. Type III reactions are due to immune complex formation. Immune complex diseases include systemic lupus erythematosus, Arthus reactions, and serum sickness."

      "options": [" Ultrafiltration  ", " Diffusion  ", " Osmosis  ", " Active transport   "],
      "answers": [" Active transport   "],
      "explanation": "The ciliary processes of the pars plicata produce the aqueous humor. It is created by three different methods which are as described below. &#10;&#10;Active transport produces the majority of aqueous humor. It requires the use of sodium, chloride and bicarbonate ions that serve to create an osmotic gradient between the interdigitations of the non-pigmented epithelial cells of the ciliary body. This creates a higher concentration of solutes inside the cells near their tight junctions which diminishes towards the posterior chamber, pulling water into the posterior chamber. &#10;&#10;Ultrafiltration accounts for a small amount of aqueous produced. Fluid is pushed out of the ciliary processes via capillary hydrostatic forces (blood pressure). &#10;&#10;Diffusion is responsible for producing a very small amount of aqueous. Particles in fluid flow down their concentration gradient moving from an area of high concentration to an area of low particle concentration."

      "answers": [" Upper and lower lids close lateral to medial direction, globe moves posteriorly  "],
      "explanation": "During the closure portion of a blink, the eyelids close in a zipper-like fashion beginning laterally to medially. This pushes the tears into the caniculi. The globe itself is pushed further back into the orbit (most likely for defensive purposes). Upon opening, the lids open in a medial to lateral direction. &#10;&#10;Facts about blinking: &#10;The eyes close twice as fast as they open. &#10;The normal blink rate at rest is 12-15 times a minute. The blink rate increases with excitement and decreases during periods of increased concentration such as computer work and reading."

      "explanation": "A hyphema is defined as blood in the anterior chamber, which typically pools inferiorly. When a patient presents with an acute hyphema, gonioscopy is contraindicated as it may increase the likelihood of re-bleeding and should be performed 2-4 weeks after the initial trauma, allowing time for the blood to clear from the anterior chamber. Evaluation of a hyphema should include observation of the anterior chamber to assess for potential damage to the cornea or iris. Intraocular pressure will likely be elevated. It is also important to ensure that the globe is not compromised and that orbital fractures are absent. Gonioscopy should be performed several weeks later to evaluate the angle for possible recession. &#10;&#10;Gonioscopy: A Text and Atlas. Dada, T., Sharma, R. & Sobti, A. Jaypee, 2013, page 8."

      "options": [" Vitiligo  ", " Blepharoclonus   ", " Lid myokymia  ", " Ankyloblepharon  "],
      "answers": [" Blepharoclonus   "],
      "explanation": "Blepharoclonus is commonly seen in children 5-10 years of age, and frequently no cause can be determined. The condition presents as either increased blink rate (the most common form) or increased duration of lid closure. It is important to rule out any possible external cause such as irritation to a portion of the anterior segment, especially that of the cornea. The condition is self-limiting, but sometimes artificial tears can help alleviate the frequency. Blepharoclonus can also be seen in patients suffering from brainstem lesions due to trauma or stroke; it is also seen with patients suffering from multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. As a precaution, some practitioners recommend a neurological consult. &#10;&#10;Lid myokymia presents as intermittent, unilateral lid twitching; this can stem from a myriad of causes, such as fatigue, stress, anemia, increased levels of caffeine, alcohol or tobacco ingestion, and dry eyes, to name a few. This condition is generally self-limiting and will resolve, especially if the stimulus is removed. &#10;&#10;Ankyloblepharon can be congenital or can occur secondary to pathology. This condition causes the margins of the upper and lower lid to adhere to one another (generally at the lateral canthus). &#10;&#10;Vitiligo: Think of Michael Jackson: This condition presents as patchy depigmentation of the skin and sometimes depigmentation of the eyelashes and hair as well."

      "answers": [" Vossius ring   "],
      "explanation": "A Vossius ring occurs due to trauma which causes the posterior surface of the iris to rub against the anterior portion of the lens. Remnants of melanocytes from the pupillary border remain adherent to the lens, causing a ring of pigment. A Vossius ring does not require treatment unless it immensely interferes with vision (which is rare). Because it is an opacity on the lens it is considered a cataract. &#10;&#10;Epicapsular stars are congenital and appear as small pigment deposits on the anterior portion of the lens. This is a benign finding that rarely interferes with vision. &#10;&#10;Persistent pupillary membrane is the result of a failure of fetal tissue to atrophy. In the womb, blood is supplied to the lens via a grouping of blood vessels that generally regress and atrophy by birth. Occasionally they do not fully disintegrate leading to cobweb-like strands generally attached to the iris. Rarely does this condition affect vision. &#10;&#10;Crocodile shagreen is a benign corneal finding commonly seen in the elderly. Crocodile shagreen appears in the peripheral cornea as polygonal white opacities."

      "answers": [" 11-cis-retinal isomerizes to all-trans-retinal   "],
      "explanation": "In the human visual cycle, light is converted into electrical signals in rod and cone photoreceptors in order for vision to occur. This process begins when opsins, which contain the 11-cis-retinal chromophore, absorb a photon of light. Once struck by a photon, 11-cis-retinal undergoes photoisomerization to the all-trans state (all-trans-retinal). This change leads to signal transduction cascades that eventually result in the closure of a cyclic GMP-gated cation channel and subsequent hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor cell. &#10;&#10;After this occurs, all-trans-retinal is reduced to all-trans-retinol. It then travels back to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) where it is esterfied and then converted to 11-cis-retinol. It is finally oxidized to 11-cis-retinal before traveling back to the photoreceptor outer segment and attaching to an opsin, forming a new, functional visual pigment that is ready for photoisomerization again."

Catecholamines are sympathomimetic 'fight-or-flight' hormones released by the adrenal glands in response to stress. Acetylcholine utilizes choline as its building block. It is a parasympathomimetic hormone and therefore is not classified as a catecholamine. Serotonin is derived from tryptophan and is also not considered a catecholamine. Cortisol is a steroid hormone and is not a neurotransmitter."

      "answers": [" Acids donate protons   "],
      "explanation": "Acids are regarded as proton donors, and bases are considered proton acceptors. In solution, strong acids will completely ionize while weak acids will partially ionize. &#10;&#10;The amount of ionization of a weak base is dependent upon the Ka value (also known as the acid dissociation constant). Ka = [H][A-]/[HA]. A higher Ka value results in a greater amount of ionized acid, which is inversely related to pKa. pKa = -logKa. A higher Ka (or a lower pKa) indicates a stronger acid. &#10;&#10;pH is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in solution. A higher pH corresponds to a more basic solution. pH= -log[H+]."

      "answers": [" Red blood cells   "],
      "explanation": "Insulin is a hormone secreted by the beta cells of the pancreas in response to elevated blood glucose. The target sites for insulin are the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle cells where the hormone stimulates anabolic pathways. In muscle cells, there is an increase in the uptake of glucose. &#10;&#10;In the liver, glucokinase and glycogen synthase are activated; this results in an increase in the uptake of glucose and an increase in the synthesis of glycogen respectively. The enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase is also activated, causing a rise in fatty acid synthesis. Conversely, glycogen phosphorylase is inhibited, producing a decrease in the breakdown of glycogen. &#10;&#10;Lipoprotein lipase enzymes are activated in adipose tissue triggering an increase in the synthesis of triglycerides. &#10;&#10;Red blood cells, brain cells, lens fiber cells, and kidney cells do not require insulin for proper functioning and therefore do not possess insulin receptors. Glucose entry into these cells is not regulated by insulin but rather the concentration difference of glucose levels on the inside versus the outside of the cell. Muscle cells and adipose cells require insulin receptors which mediate the transportation of glucose into the cells. Insulin-independent cells are therefore more susceptible to damage in diabetes cases as the glucose intake into these tissues is not as regulated as those that possess insulin receptors."

      "explanation": "H1 receptors are the primary histamine receptors found in the eye. The allergic response is initiated when an antigen (animal dander, pollen, etc.) binds to the IgE receptor and causes mast cell degranulation leading to the release of histamines, prostaglandins, tryptase, and heparin (the last two being inflammatory mediators). Histamine then binds to the H1 receptors located on nerves (leads to itching) and blood vessels (causes chemosis and erythema)."

      "answers": [" Zymogens  "],
      "explanation": "Pepsinogen and fibrinogen are categorized as zymogens. Zymogens, also called proenzymes, are synthesized as inactive proteins that later become activated via some type of transformation, for example, cleavage of a portion of the protein resulting in a functional enzyme. The enzymes cannot be reverted back to their inactive forms. Blood-clotting factors and digestive enzymes are common examples of zymogens. The zymogen pepsinogen is secreted from chief cells in the stomach and is converted to its active form, pepsin, via exposure to hydrochloric acid. The enzyme pepsin aids in the digestion of proteins. &#10;&#10;Allosteric enzymes are regulatory proteins that are controlled via modulators. The modulators activate or inhibit the enzyme function by binding to a location on the enzyme that is not the active site. &#10;&#10;Isoenzymes are enzymes that are molecularly different but catalyze the same reaction. Isozymes have different amino acid sequences than other enzymes, but both used for the same reaction. &#10;&#10;Sphingolipids are important for central nervous system (CNS) function. They are generally incorporated into CNS membranes."

      "options": [" Amine hormones  ", " Non-steroid hormones  ", " Peptide hormones   ", " Steroid hormones  "],
      "answers": [" Steroid hormones  "],
      "explanation": "Hormones that are derived from the parent molecule cholesterol are classified as steroid hormones and are lipid-soluble. These hormones include testosterone, estrogens, progesterone, aldosterone, and cortisol. Due to the fact that these hormones are lipid-soluble, they are capable of diffusing through the plasma membrane of the target cell; also, they can bind to a receptor on the membrane. Once inside the cell, these hormones bind to a receptor in the cytoplasm or on the membrane of the nucleus; this complex then moves into the nucleus to alter protein synthesis, turning genes off or on. &#10;&#10;Amine hormones (norepinephrine and epinephrine) and peptide hormones (ADH, oxytocin and TRH) are non-steroidal because they are derived from amino acids and are therefore water-soluble. These hormones bind to receptors on the membrane of the target cell, and, in the majority of instances, alter the cell's function by activating a second messenger system such as cyclic AMP."

Multiple amino acids bonded together in this manner form a peptide (polymers of amino acids). A peptide consisting of two amino acids is termed a dipeptide; one that is comprised of three amino acids is called a tripeptide and so forth. Peptides possess an 'N' terminal end and a 'C' terminal end. Aspartame is a man-made peptide that contains aspartate and phenylalanine with an added methyl ester group, which is responsible for the sweet taste. &#10;&#10;Glutathione is an important tripeptide made up of glutamate-cysteine-glutamate.

      "explanation": "Progesterone, aldosterone, testosterone, estradiol and cortisol are all derived from cholesterol. Cholesterol has a unique configuration comprised of four joined cycloalkane rings. Because these hormones are fat-soluble, they readily pass through cell membranes. They diffuse into the blood and are generally bound to carrier proteins, which transport the hormones to their designated target site where they may further undergo processing or transformation. &#10;&#10;Sphingolipids are important in cell membranes, especially those located in the central nervous system, such as myelin sheath. Sphingolipids contain sphingosine as a backbone and are then further classified depending on which molecules are attached to that backbone, such as ceremides, gangliosides, sphingomyelin, etc. &#10;&#10;Phospholipids contain a polar and non-polar end, thus making them amphoteric. This property allows for the formation of bilayers (polar ends aligned together and pointed outwards) resulting in the lipid bilayer commonly seen in cell membranes. Phospholipids are generally comprised of a phosphate group, a choline group (polar), and two fatty acid chains (non-polar) attached to glycerol, which serves as the backbone.&#10;&#10;Triglycerides are comprised of three fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol backbone.

Once the inhibitor is bound, the enzyme cannot bind to the substrate, leading to decreased product formation. Competitive inhibitors can also bind to another site on the enzyme that causes a conformational change to the enzyme, disabling its ability to bind its substrate (allosteric inhibition). Competitive inhibitors cannot bind to the allosteric site once a substrate is bound. However, increasing the concentration of the substrate will allow it to out-compete the inhibitor, thus allowing for proper saturation of the enzyme. &#10;&#10;A non-competitive inhibitor binds to a location on the enzyme that is not the actual active site but still causes the enzyme to become inactive. The substrate is still capable of binding to the enzyme, but there is no product created since the enzyme has been rendered inactive. &#10;&#10;The addition of a competitive inhibitor does not alter the y-intercept value but does lead to an increase in the slope of the Lineweaver-Burk plot. Competitive inhibitors cause an increase in the Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) but do not alter the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the reaction. Therefore, the y-intercept remains unchanged but the slope increases; and the x-intercept is also altered. &#10;&#10;Non-competitive inhibitors result in a decreased Vmax but no change to the Km value; this changes the y-intercept and increases the slope but leaves the x-intercept unaltered."

      "options": [" DNA helicase   ", " DNA polymerase  ", " DNA topoisomerase  ", " DNA primase  "],
      "answers": [" DNA polymerase  "],
      "explanation": "DNA polymerase (there are several) is responsible for the addition of nucleotides during DNA replication. Polymerase joins the new base to an old base via a phosphodiester bond elongating the strand from the 5' end to the 3' end. Polymerases are very accurate and proofread the new strand. If a base is incorrect, the enzyme will remove it. &#10;&#10;Helicases and topoisomerases are responsible for unwinding the helix and separating the strands to expose the template for replication, resulting in a replication fork. &#10;&#10;Primase adds the RNA primer that is necessary to initiate the replication sequence. Without a primer, replication cannot occur. After replication is complete the RNA primers are excised by exonucleases, and DNA polymerase I adds DNA to the now vacated spots. All gaps are filled in via DNA ligase resulting in the formation of two identical DNA strands."

      "options": [" Enolase  ", " Phosphofructokinase   ", " Phosphoglycerate mutase  ", " Aldolase  "],
      "answers": [" Phosphofructokinase   "],
      "explanation": "Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway responsible for the breakdown of glucose. The net result of glycolysis is 2 pyruvate molecules, 2 ATP, 2H+ and 2 NADH (although technically, it produces 4 ATP, but 2 ATP are used in the breakdown of glucose). Glycolysis is a complex pathway that involves many enzymes and the input of energy in the form of ATP. The initial steps of glycolysis are as follows: &#10;&#10;glucose (+ATP) --> glucose-6-phosphate<--> fructose-6-phosphate (+ ATP) --> fructose 1,6-biphosphate. &#10;&#10;The conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-biphosphate is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase and is irreversible. This is also the rate-limiting step as well as a main controlling point in glycolysis. The majority of the reactions in glycolysis are reversible, which is important for gluconeogenesis (the creation of glucose). Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is inhibited by high levels of ATP. Therefore when ATP is present in higher concentrations, glycolysis is suppressed. During these occasions, glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver."

      "explanation": "Enzymes are proteins that serve as catalysts for many reactions. They are very specific in the substrates or reactants that they bind. Due to the fact that enzymes are proteins, they are susceptible to denaturation if there is a large change in either the pH or temperature of their environment. Either of these changes will lead to a decrease in productivity of the enzyme or a complete loss of function. Enzymes serve to reduce the amount of energy that is needed in order for the reaction to occur. By lowering the energy of activation, the rate of the reaction can proceed much more rapidly."

      "explanation": "There are a total of 20 amino acids typically found and used in human peptides and proteins. Ten of these are considered absolutely essential because humans do not possess the ability to synthesize them, and they are necessary for normal functioning. The essential amino acids must be supplied via ingestion from external sources. Non-essential amino acids can be fabricated from carbohydrate sources via the tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis and pentose phosphate shunt, or their intermediates. &#10;&#10;The non-essential amino acids include: alanine, asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, and tyrosine. Essential amino acids are: arginine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine, and histidine. Although the list varies between what is deemed essential and what is non-essential, it is rather a moot point since all of the amino acids are required by our system."

Passive diffusion refers to the movement of molecules through a plasma membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration without the use of carrier molecules. Active transport implies the movement of material against its respective concentration gradient. This type of transport requires energy and enlists the use of specific carrier proteins. Lastly, group translocation is defined as the chemical modification of a molecule while it is being transported into a cell; for example, sugars are often phosphorylated during transportation."

      "options": [" Gallbladder  ", " Pancreas  ", " Liver   ", " Stomach  "],
      "answers": [" Liver   "],
      "explanation": "Gluconeogenesis occurs predominantly in the liver cells. Gluconeogenesis is the process by which glucose is synthesized from non-carbohydrate sources such as lactate, glucogenic amino acids, or glycerol. It is important to note that fatty acids CANNOT be used in the formation of glucose. Gluconeogenesis requires the expenditure of ATP and GTP. This process is essentially the reverse of glycolysis except that the three irreversible steps undergone in glycolysis must be by-passed. The fact that glycolysis cannot be directly and easily reversed is important for proper regulation of glucose levels. &#10;&#10;In glycolysis, the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-biphosphate is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase and is irreversible. In gluconeogenesis, the reversal of this process and the creation of fructose-6-phosphate from fructose 1,6-biphosphate requires the enzyme fructose 1,6,biphosphatase. Also, in glycolysis, glucose is transformed to glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P) via the enzyme hexokinase. Conversely, in gluconeogenesis, G-6-P is converted back to glucose by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase. Another important distinction is the enzyme pyruvate kinase of glycolysis is replaced with the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxykinase, which is used to convert oxaloacetate into phosphoenolpyruvate in gluconeogenesis."

      "explanation": "Familial hypercholesterolemia is the result of elevated blood levels of cholesterol. Normally, cholesterol is carried to cells via low-density lipoproteins. Target cells possess receptors for LDL; once LDL is bound, the receptors initiate endocytosis, bringing cholesterol into the cell for digestion by lysozymes. The receptors are then recycled. People who suffer from familial hypercholesterolemia possess defective LDL receptors; as such, cholesterol is unable to enter the cell, leading to increased blood levels of cholesterol."

The formation of fatty acids is catalyzed via the enzyme acetyl CoA reductase, which is activated by citrate. Acetyl CoA reductase is allosterically inhibited by palmitoyl-CoA. Fatty acid synthesis occurs in the cytosol and requires the use of ATP and NADPH, as this is a complex anabolic process. &#10;&#10;A brief overview and important points of the pathway are as follows: Essentially, acetyl CoA combines with oxaloacetate (OAA) in the mitochondria to form citrate, which is then shuttled out into the cytosol by the citrate shuttle. Once in the cytosol, citrate is broken down again into its constituents, OAA and acetyl CoA. OAA is converted back into pyruvate to re-gain entry into the mitochondria. Acetyl CoA is converted to malonyl-CoA via acetyl CoA carboxylase (rate-limiting step and uses biotin as a cofactor). Malonyl CoA and the acyl carrier protein undergo several reactions to create fatty acid."

The rate of the reaction will reach its maximal velocity when the enzyme becomes saturated, at which point the addition of substrate will not alter the reaction rate as there are no more available enzymes. Plotting the saturation curve for an enzyme demonstrates that as the amount of substrate increases, the reaction rate also increases in an almost linear fashion; however, as the enzyme reaches its saturation point, the curve will flatten out and the reaction rate will cease to increase. &#10;&#10;Remember; Km=[S]when v=1/2 Vm!"

These end products are then absorbed by enterocytes that line the walls of the intestine. Once in the enterocytes, triglycerides are then rebuilt and packaged along with cholesterol and protein to form chylomicrons. The chylomicrons are able to enter the lymph system, where they are absorbed into the blood stream and transported to the liver or adipose tissue. Triglycerides cannot directly diffuse through the cell membranes of the liver or adipose tissue; they must first be broken down into fatty acids and glycerol. This process is made possible by lipoprotein lipases located on the walls of blood vessels. The fatty acids and glycerol are then absorbed by the liver for energy or taken up by adipose tissue and re-synthesized into triglycerides for storage purposes."

The offending nucleotides can be excised by the body but, if they are left, dimers can causes melanomas in humans. &#10;&#10;Acridine used to be a main component in hair dye. This chemical would become incorporated via intercalation into DNA and lead to frameshift mutations secondary to insertion of nucleotides. A base analog is a chemical that resembles a nucleotide and may become incorporated into DNA, which leads to faulty base pairing.

      "question": "Which of the following regarding deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is FALSE?",
      "options": [" It is helical in shape with a hydrophobic core  ", " It is composed of polymers of nucleotides linked via phosphodiester bonds  ", " DNA is double-stranded  ", " Complementary base pairs include AU and GC   "],
      "answers": [" Complementary base pairs include AU and GC   "],
      "explanation": "Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) contains genetic information necessary for proper function and development of living organisms. It consists of polymers of nucleotides which are linked via phosphodiester bonds. DNA is double-stranded and contains the complementary base AT and CG, which are linked in an antiparallel fashion. GC bonds are stronger than AT bonds as they contain more hydrogen bonds (3 vs. 2 respectively). Therefore, DNA with a higher CG content is considered more stable. The DNA strands are wound in a right-handed tightly coiled helix. The nucleobases are centered towards the core, causing the center of the helix to be hydrophobic."

      "question": "An amphipathic molecule will react in what manner when exposed to water?",
      "options": [" It will completely dissolve  ", " It will form a gas  ", " It will form micelles   ", " It will combust  "],
      "answers": [" It will form micelles   "],
      "explanation": "Amphipathic molecules, such as phosphatidylcholine, contain both polar and non-polar components. Because water is polar, it will dissolve other polar compounds (like dissolves like). Upon exposure to water, the hydrophilic polar elements of the amphipathic molecule will begin to align and point outwards towards the water, eventually forming small spheres called micelles. The inner portion of the micelle is comprised of the non-polar elements which are hydrophobic. Micelle formation increases the entropy of water molecules; therefore, the water molecules are less ordered; this is a more favorable outcome. If the solvent is non-polar, then an inverse micelle will form, with the hydrophobic portions pointing outwards. Entropy is a measure of disorder; higher entropy entails less order. Lipid bilayers are formed based on the principals of micelle formation."

      "question": "Why is the formation of ketone bodies detrimental to the body?",
      "options": [
        " Ketone bodies become favorably metabolized over glucose  ",
        " Ketone bodies disrupt the function of fatty acid synthesis  ",

        " Ketone bodies become incorporated into nucleic acids  "
      ],
      "answers": [" Ketone bodies are acidic and lower the pH of blood   "],
      "explanation": "Ketoacidosis can occur during periods of starvation, low carbohydrate levels, when there is excessive breakdown of fats, or in uncontrolled diabetes. Carbohydrate catabolism is always favored over the formation of ketone bodies. When there is an excessive amount of acetyl-CoA present, ketone bodies are formed (for instance, acetone). When the body is starving, the brain uses ketones as a fuel source to maintain regulatory functions. The ketone bodies are acidic and can lower the pH of blood. Warning signs include: vomiting, flushed skin, difficulty breathing, and confusion. A key sign to watch and/or smell for is fruity breath or breath that smells like nail polish remover. Ketoacidosis can lead to a diabetic coma or death. People with Type I diabetes are more susceptible to ketoacidosis than those suffering from Type II."

      "answers": [" Loss of electrons   "],
      "explanation": "In oxidation/reduction reactions, the chemical species that undergoes oxidation loses electrons and becomes positively charged, or stated differently, its oxidation state increases. Conversely, those species that become reduced will gain electrons and become negatively charged. Mnemonic = OIL RIG. Oxidation Is Loss of electrons, Reduction Is Gain of electrons. Because electrons are negatively charged, if the species gains electrons it will also become more negatively charged and reduced. &#10;For example: 2Ag+ (aq) + 2e- = 2 Ag (s) &#10;Silver becomes reduced with the addition of electrons and loses its positive charge. &#10;&#10;In true terms, oxidation and reduction refer to an increase or decrease in the oxidation number, respectively. Not all redox reactions result in the transfer of electrons."

      "answers": [" Packaged into chylomicrons  "],
      "explanation": "Fat is digested primarily in the intestine. It enters the intestine from the stomach, where it becomes emulsified by bile salts and hydrolyzed by lipases released from the pancreas. These end products are then absorbed by enterocytes that line the walls of the intestine. Once inside, the enterocytes, triglycerides are then rebuilt and packaged along with cholesterol and protein to form chylomicrons. The chylomicrons are able to enter the lymph system, where they are absorbed into the blood stream and transported to the liver or adipose tissue. Triglycerides cannot directly diffuse through the cell membranes of the liver or adipose tissue; they must first be broken down into fatty acids and glycerol. This process is made possible by the presence of lipoprotein lipases on the walls of blood vessels. The fatty acids and glycerol are then absorbed by the liver to be used for energy or taken up by adipose tissue, where they are re-synthesized into triglycerides for storage purposes."

As the electrons are transferred, energy is released that is used to pump protons (H+) out of the membrane to create a pH gradient; this serves to drive adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. Coenzyme Q, also known as ubiquinone, transfers electrons from complex I to complex III as well as from complex II to complex III. Cytochrome C serves as an electron carrier between complex III and complex IV. Complex IV then delivers the electron to oxygen, which acts as the terminal electron acceptor. NADH and FADH2 are the initial electron donors that pass the electrons into complex I and complex II respectively; the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation thus ensues.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Solute Transfer"

      "explanation": "Once transcription has occurred, the primary transcript may undergo further processing, resulting in functional RNA. In order for processing to occur, a 5' methylated cap must first be added to the primary transcript which helps to serve as a recognition marker during the synthesis of proteins. A 3' polyadenylate tail is then added, which helps to keep the RNA from becoming degraded. Lastly, introns are spliced out of the nucleotide sequence, while exons remain in the mature RNA; the exons are shuttled into the cytoplasm and utilized in translation."

Pyruvate is transformed into acetyl-CoA via the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase. Acetyl CoA joins with oxaloacetate (OAA) to create citrate, which then enters the TCA cycle and goes through a series of chemical transformations with help from multiple enzymes used to catalyze the reactions. For every acetyl-CoA group that is metabolized, 2 CO2 molecules are created along with 3 NADH coenzymes and FADH2. NADH and FADH2 are then used by the electron transport chain (ETC). The final product of the TCA cycle is oxaloacetate; this OAA then feeds back into the cycle to combine with acetyl-CoA."

This is achieved via the transfer of electrons through redox reactions and protein complexes. The transfer of electrons from electron donors to electron acceptors releases energy that is then used to pump protons (H+) from the matrix of the mitochondrion into the intermembrane space (this process is called chemiosmosis). The difference in pH created across the membrane causes the protons to flow back into the mitochondrial matrix down its respective concentration gradient through a pore in the enzyme ATP synthase. This proton flow provides the energy necessary for ATP synthase to phosphorylate ADP and form ATP."

      "options": [" Quaternary  ", " Tertiary  ", " Secondary  ", " Primary  "],
      "answers": [" Secondary  "],
      "explanation": "Alpha helices and beta sheets are categorized as secondary structures. &#10;&#10;Primary structures are the initial sequences of amino acids that will eventually code for the final structure of the protein. Primary structures are held together via peptide bonds. &#10;&#10;Secondary structures are formed by folding chains of amino acids into a helix or sheet. The helices are coiled so that the R side chains face away from the center of the helix. The beta sheets can be folded in a parallel pattern, where all of the N terminals are located at the same end of the sheet, or in an anti-parallel pattern, where the N and C terminals alternate at the ends of the sheet. Secondary structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the peptide bond groups. &#10;&#10;Tertiary structure refers to the final overall three-dimensional shape of the protein. Bonding between the side chains causes folding and twisting of the protein. There are four types of bonding that occur at this level; hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions between non-polar side groups (weak), disulfide bonds (strong, covalent) and salt bridges (also called electrostatic attraction). Electrostatic forces deals with the overall charge of the side groups. A positively charged group will be attracted to a negatively charged group. Disulfide bonds form when the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine become oxidized. &#10;&#10;Quaternary proteins can be classified as either globular or fibrous. Quaternary proteins are oligomeric, meaning that they are created through the bonding of several peptide units. Globular proteins (for example hemoglobin) are generally compact, water-soluble and ball-shaped. Most globular proteins are enzymes. Fibrous proteins tend to be elongated, strong, and not water-soluble. Fibrous proteins (for example collagen) tend to serve a structural role."

      "answers": [" Point   ", " Silent   ", " Frame-shift   "],
      "explanation": "Recombination refers to a process in which genetic elements from two different genomes are combined together into one unit. A point mutation results from the change of a single base. Point mutations can lead to missense mutations, silent mutations, and nonsense mutations. Missense mutations are caused by the alteration of a single nucleotide, resulting in a codon that now codes for a different amino acid. Silent mutations occur when a single base is changed but the actual codon still codes for the same amino acid. For instance, ACC is altered to CGG both codons code for arginine. Nonsense mutations are the result of a changed nucleotide that leads to a stop codon. For example, CAG is altered to UAG. CAG codes for the amino acid lysine, but UAG is a stop codon, causing premature completion of a protein. Deletion or insertion of a single or multiple bases usually results in frame-shift mutations and may lead to a complete loss of ability to produce necessary proteins."

      "answers": [" Transport protein   "],
      "explanation": "Proteins are created via polymers of amino acids which are linked together by peptide bonds. Proteins vary in their structure and function. &#10;&#10;Transport proteins are created to bind specific molecules and transfer them to their designated destinations. Hemoglobin is designed to carry oxygen. &#10;&#10;Contractile proteins (collagen, for example) are important in maintaining structural support. &#10;&#10;Regulatory proteins serve to manage physiological processes such as controlling blood sugar via insulin and glucagon. &#10;&#10;Enzymes are proteins that alter the rate of a reaction. An example of a biological enzyme is DNA helicase which serves to uncoil DNA."

      "options": [" Simple diffusion through the cellular membrane  ", " Carnitine shuttle   ", " Chylomicrons  ", " Micelles  "],
      "answers": [" Carnitine shuttle   "],
      "explanation": "Triglycerides are an important energy source. Fat is stored in adipose tissue where it gets converted into fatty acyl-CoAs by glucagon and epinephrine when energy levels become depleted. When there is a demand for energy, the fatty acids in adipose tissue diffuse out of the cell and join with blood albumin to be transported to peripheral tissues. The fatty acids diffuse into muscle or liver cells, where they become activated to fatty acyl-CoAs and are transported via the carnitine shuttle from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria. Once in the mitochondria, the fatty acyl-CoAs undergo multiple rounds of beta oxidation; each cycle removes two carbons from the fatty acyl-CoAs. Each rotation of beta oxidation produces one mole of FADH2, one NADH and one acetyl-CoA. Each acetyl-CoA then enters the TCA cycle to undergo further oxidation to produce 3 NADH, 1 FADH2 (which are then used by electron transport chain) and one mole of ATP. The breakdown of fatty acids yields a greater amount of energy than the oxidation of carbohydrates."

      "answers": [" Transportation of lipids   "],
      "explanation": "Lipoproteins are agents that are comprised of lipid and protein and are found in the blood. Lipoproteins serve to transport lipids. They are generally classified according to their densities, which are related to the amount of protein and lipid present. Chylomicrons are the largest lipoproteins and are used in the transportation of dietary triglycerides from the intestine to target tissues (e.g. adipose or liver). Very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) shuttle lipids (mostly triglycerides) from the liver to other tissues. Low density lipoproteins (LDL) are used to move cholesterol to various cells. Elevated levels of LDLs are associated with heart disease. Lastly, high density lipoproteins (HDL) are the smallest and also contain the most amount of protein. HDLs function to transport cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver to be broken down and excreted in bile. Elevated HDL levels are associated with 'good cholesterol'."

      "options": [" Synthesis of pyruvate dehydrogenase  ", " Creation of oxaloacetate (OAA) to be used in the Krebs cycle  ", " Catabolism of glutathione  ", " The production of NADPH   "],
      "answers": [" The production of NADPH   "],
      "explanation": "The pentose phosphate shunt has two phases. One of the phases is oxidative in nature and is not reversible. The primary function of this phase is the production of NADPH and the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate (shunted from glycolysis) to ribulose-5-phosphate and carbon dioxide. Ribulose-5-phosphate is used in the synthesis of nucleic acids and nucleotides. The oxidative phase is controlled by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-P DH). G-6-P DH is inhibited by elevated levels of NADPH. If this enzyme functions improperly, a deficiency of NADPH will result. NADPH is important for the proper performance of glutathione. Glutathione is a very powerful peptide produced by the body to protect the system from oxidative damage. Accumulation of oxidative damage can be mutagenic. &#10;&#10;The second phase of the pentose phosphate shunt is non-oxidative and reversible. The main purpose of this phase is to shuffle carbons back into the glycolysis pathway by breaking down ribulose-5-phosphate. The two important enzymes to remember in this phase are transketolase and transaldolase. &#10;&#10;Pyruvate dehydrogenase is used for the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which is then fed into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle). The synthesis of pyruvate dehydrogenase is not controlled via the pentose phosphate shunt. &#10;&#10;Ref: Guyton and Hall, Textbook of Medical Physiology 10th ed. (2000) page 775-776."

      "answers": [" The liver and adipose tissue   "],
      "explanation": "During times of depressed blood glucose levels, glucagon is released by the pancreas. Glucagon then travels to the liver and adipose tissue where it stimulates catabolic pathways. In the liver, glucagon causes the activation of glycogen phosphorylase, causing the breakdown of glycogen. The enzyme fructose-1,6-biphosphatase is also stimulated, which triggers gluconeogenesis. Lastly, glycogen synthase and phosphofructokinase are inhibited, resulting in decreased glycogen synthesis and inhibition of glycolysis, respectively. &#10;&#10;Glucagon also increases the activity of lipase causing hydrolysis of triglycerides in adipose tissue creating free fatty acids which are released into the blood stream and delivered to liver and muscle cells in order to be further broken down for the acquisition of energy."

      "answers": [" This means that the reaction is exergonic   "],
      "explanation": "A reaction that has a negative change in free energy (delta G) is considered exergonic. The energy of the reactants is greater than the energy of the end products; therefore, the formation of products leads to a release of energy. This type of reaction is spontaneous and favors the formation of products. Because the synthesis of products is favorable, at equilibrium the concentration of products would be greater than the amount of reactants. A reaction with a positive change in free energy is non-spontaneous and endergonic (requires energy); the concentration of the reactants is greater than that of the product at equilibrium."

      "answers": [" They both contain bases A, C and G  "],
      "explanation": "Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) contains genetic information necessary for proper function and development of living organisms. It consists of polymers of nucleotides which are linked via phosphodiester bonds. DNA is double-stranded and contains the complementary base AT and CG which are linked in an antiparallel fashion. GC bonds are stronger than AT bonds as they contain more hydrogen bonds (3 vs. 2, respectively). The DNA strands are wound in a right-handed tightly coiled helix. The nucleobases are centered towards the core, causing the center of the helix to be hydrophobic. The DNA backbone is composed of repeating patterns of a sugar (2-deoxyribose which is a 5-carbon sugar) and phosphate groups. &#10;&#10;RNA is single stranded and has a backbone made up repeating units of a ribose sugar and a phosphate group. RNA is not helical but can take on many different secondary structure configurations such as hairpins and loops. RNA contains the base pairs adenine, uracil, cytosine and guanine, whereas DNA utilizes thymine in lieu of uracil."

      "explanation": "Eicosanoids are derivatives of arachidonic acid. Examples of eicosanoids include leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and thromboxanes. &#10;&#10;Progesterone, aldosterone, testosterone, estradiol and cortisol are all derived from cholesterol. Cholesterol has a unique configuration comprised of four joined cycloalkane rings. Because these hormones are fat-soluble, they readily pass through cell membranes. They diffuse into the blood and are generally bound to carrier proteins that transport the hormones to their designated target site, where they may further undergo further processing or transformation. &#10;&#10;Triglycerides are comprised of three fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol backbone. Triglycerides are important in long-term energy storage for use by cells. &#10;&#10;Coenzyme Q, all steroids, cholesterol, and vitamins A, D, E, and K are derived from isoprenes or terpenes.

      "options": [" UAU tyrosine  ", " GUU valine  ", " AUG methionine   ", " CAA glutamine  "],
      "answers": [" AUG methionine   "],
      "explanation": "AUG (methionine) is the universal initiation codon for protein synthesis in eukaryotes (ATG for DNA). Stop codons are UAA, UAG, and UGA (for RNA) which terminate protein synthesis. Protein synthesis begins with transcription of messenger RNA from DNA. The mature messenger RNA is then transported into the cytoplasm where the codon AUG signals for the initiation of protein synthesis. The initiation complex is formed via ribosomal subunits, tRNA (transfer RNA), mRNA (messenger RNA), initiation factors and GTP (for energy). The 80s (70s for prokaryotes) ribosomal subunit contains a P site (peptidyl) and an A site (acceptor). The transfer RNA that is bound to methionine (AUG) binds to the P site; and a second tRNA with the proper anticodon sequence and associated amino acid binds to the A site. The amino acids carried by the initial two tRNAs are then bound together via peptidyl transferase and elongation factors. The ribosome then advances three base pairs (one codon) and releases the first tRNA. The P site is now occupied by the second tRNA, which has vacated the A site. The tRNA that contains the appropriate anticodon that matches the codon of the mRNA will then bind to the A site along with its respective amino acid. The new amino acid will bind to the first two amino acids, creating a polypeptide chain. This sequence continues until a stop codon is encountered by the ribosome on the mRNA. At this point releasing factors and ATP causes dissociation of the ribosomal complex and the protein and mRNA are released. The mRNA is decoded from the 5' end to the 3' end. Proteins are synthesized from the N terminal to the C terminal. While it elongates, the amino acids of the polypeptide chain interact, causing folding /looping of the growing protein. &#10;&#10;&#10;A great illustration of this is seen at: http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/olcweb/cgi/pluginpop.cgi?it=swf::535::535::/sites/dl/free/0072437316/120077/micro06.swf::Protein%20Synthesis"

      "options": [" Valine is substituted for glutamic acid  ", " Valine is substituted for arginine  ", " Glutamic acid is substituted for valine   ", " Arginine is substituted for glutamic acid  "],
      "answers": [" Valine is substituted for glutamic acid  "],
      "explanation": "Patients affected by sickle-cell anemia characteristically have elongated and curved (like a sickle) red blood cells instead of the normal round disc shape seen in healthy patients. Additionally, these individuals have low red blood cell counts due to the fact that the abnormally shaped red blood cells are more fragile than normal cells. The sickle shape can also lead to restriction of blood flow within capillaries, decreasing the amount of oxygen the individual's cells are able to receive. &#10;&#10;The underlying cause of sickle-cell anemia has been traced to a small structural difference in the beta subunits of hemoglobin that occurs in individuals possessing the sickle cell trait. The amino acid valine is substituted for the glutamic acid that is normally in this position. Valine and glutamic acid are very different from each other and cause a significant variation in structure of the red blood cell. The side chain in glutamic acid is ionic, while in valine it is nonpolar. This causes an additional nonpolar region to 'stick out' from the hemoglobin molecule in sickle cells. When hemoglobin is in its deoxygenated state (whether associated with normal or sickle cells), there is a nonpolar cavity formed in another region of the molecule that will attach nicely to the nonpolar region formed by valine in sickle cells. This leads to sickle-cell hemoglobin proteins linking together and forming long chains that can restrict blood flow within capillaries. There are other cases where amino acid substitutions occur within hemoglobin, but they do not result in such severe consequences as this single abnormality. &#10;&#10;Chemisty & Chemical Reactivity.

      "explanation": "When measuring the keratometry values utilizing a manual keratometer there are certain circumstances in which the reading may be out of the range of the drum values. In these cases, one will need to add a trial lens to keratometer in order to extend the ranges (lenses are added to the patient's side of the keratometer). Cases in which the curvature is steeper than the drum reading, plus trial lenses are required, and when the reading is flatter than the drum reading, minus trial lenses are necessary. &#10;In patients with steeper curvatures, typically a +1.25 trial lens is tried first. If a measurement can be found with this lens, one will need to add about 8-9D to the drum reading in order to obtain the true value. A +1.25 lens will extend the range from about 52D to 60 or 61D. &#10;If keratometry values are even steeper (in the 60-68D range), a +2.25 trial lens can be utilized to extend the drum range even more. In these cases, about 16D is added to the drum reading to reach the true keratometry value. This is the case in the above patient. &#10;If the curvature is flatter than can be measured with the manual keratometer, a minus lens can be added to extend the range in the opposite direction.

      "answers": [" -40 mmHg   "],
      "explanation": "The imbibition pressure of the corneal stroma is due to the anionic (negatively charged) repulsive forces of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which causes the tissue to expand and suck fluid into the cornea. In vitro, the imbibition pressure (IP) and the stromal swelling pressure (SP) are equivalent. However, in vivo, the IP is lower than the SP because the hydrostatic pressure induced by the intraocular pressure must be accounted for. Therefore, the average imbibition pressure of the corneal stroma is approximately -40 mmHg. &#10;&#10;Adler's Physiology of the Eye. (11th edition). 2011.

      "answers": [" 0.50   "],
      "explanation": "Eccentricity is the measurement of the asphericity of a curved surface. In the case of the human cornea, it indicates the way in which the cornea changes from a more curved central portion to a flatter periphery (also known as a prolate shape). Normal corneal eccentricity values (e values) range between +0.50 and +0.60 in humans. A higher corneal eccentricity value indicates that the cornea flattens more rapidly in the periphery; a lower eccentricity measurement would occur in a patient whose cornea flattened more slowly in the periphery. &#10;&#10;Another way to think of eccentricity is that the 'e' value designates that amount by which the cornea deviates from a perfect sphere (which has an eccentricity value of 0). A parabola has an eccentricity value of 1; a prolate ellipse (as in the normal cornea) will have an eccentricity between 0.1 and 0.9 depending on how fast the peripheral flattening occurs. Lastly, an oblate ellipsoid (as in some post myopic refractive surgical corneas) will have an eccentricity value of between -0.1 and -0.9, depending on how fast the curvature steepens in the periphery."

Studies have indicated that the refractive index of the epithelium, anterior stroma, and posterior stroma are 1.401, 1.380, and 1.373 respectively. Because the stroma comprises the majority of the thickness of the cornea, the average of the indices of refraction between the anterior and posterior surface of the stroma are typically used to determine the overall mean value of the refractive index of the entire cornea.

      "explanation": "Laser vision correction removes tissue from the cornea; however, at some point the structure of the cornea is adversely affected by having too little tissue remaining. While there have not been any studies that point to a specific depth at which most corneas become at risk, the FDA has set a minimum limit of 250 microns of thickness for the corneal bed in order to minimize the risk of ectasia. To calculate that thickness, a doctor takes the thinnest corneal pachymetry measurement and subtracts the thickness of the proposed corneal flap as well as the thickness of the ablation. The thickness of the ablation increases with increased refractive error and increased higher order aberrations; therefore, greater refractive errors require the ablation of more tissue."

      "explanation": "Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis typically runs a common clinical course that begins with characteristic signs and symptoms following an 8-10 day incubation period. Initially, patients will usually complain of eyelid edema, pain, photophobia, and lacrimation. Early conjunctival clinical signs include a mixed papillary and follicular response, hyperemia, chemosis, and subconjunctival hemorrhages that typically last for 7-21 days. In more severe cases, the development of a conjunctival membrane or pseudomembrane is possible. &#10;&#10;Corneal involvement in patients with EKC is variable, but most patients develop diffuse, fine, superficial keratitis within the first week of the onset of the disease. After about 6-13 days, focal punctate epithelial lesions that appear elevated and stain with sodium fluorescein often occur, and by day 14, subepithelial opacities develop under these focal lesions in about 20% of patients. These subepithelial infiltrates may affect vision and can persist for months to years but typically will eventually resolve without scarring or neovascularization."

      "answers": [" 500 cells/mm2   "],
      "explanation": "The central corneal endothelial density at birth is typically in the range of 5000 cells/mm2. Unlike some other mammals, humans do not have the ability to regenerate the corneal endothelial cell monolayer after injury or disease; a decline in the central corneal endothelial cell density with age has been well-documented. In early life, there is a faster decrease in endothelial cell density, in which it declines to approximately 3500 cells/mm2 by the age of 5, and to 3000 cells/mm2 by age 14-20. Thereafter, there is a much slower decline in which the cell density decreases at a fairly constant rate of about 0.3 to 0.6% each year. This results in an endothelial cell density of about 2500 cells/mm2 in late adulthood. Even with a steady decline in endothelial cells, the cornea is able to maintain transparency due to the migration, expansion, and thinning of the surviving endothelial cells to cover a larger area (also known as polymegathism and pleomorphism). It is because of these morphological cellular changes that corneal decompensation does not usually occur unless the endothelial cell density reaches a level of 500 cells/mm2, or a 90% decrease from birth. In healthy individuals, there appears to be plenty of reserve remaining after the average human lifespan. &#10;&#10;Adler's Physiology of the Eye. (11th edition). 2011.

      "question": "You are measuring the curvature of your keratoconic patient's cornea using a manual keratometer.

      "answers": [" 59.00D   "],
      "explanation": "When measuring the keratometry values utilizing a manual keratometer there are certain circumstances in which the reading may be out of the range of the drum values. In these cases, one will need to add a trial lens to the keratometer in order to extend the ranges (lenses are added to the patient's side of the keratometer). Cases in which the curvature is steeper than the drum reading, plus trial lenses are required, and when the reading is flatter than the drum reading, minus trial lenses are necessary. &#10;In patients with steeper curvatures, typically a +1.25 trial lens is tried first. If a measurement can be found with this lens one will need to add about 8-9D to the drum reading in order to obtain the true value. A +1.25 lens will extend the range from about 52D to 60 or 61D. In the case of the above patient, adding about 8.5D will result in a true value of 59.00D. &#10;If keratometry values are even steeper (in the 60-68D range), a +2.25 trial lens can be utilized to extend the drum range even more. In these cases, about 16D is added to the drum reading to reach the true keratometry value. &#10;If the curvature is flatter than can be measured with the manual keratometer, a minus lens can be added to extend the range in the opposite direction. Typically a -1.00 trial lens will encompass a keratometry reading from about 32-38D. If a -1.00 lens is added, one will need to subtract 6D from the drum reading."

      "options": [" A dellen  ", " Limbal girdle of Vogt  ", " Corneal abrasion   ", " Arcus senilis  "],
      "answers": [" Corneal abrasion   "],
      "explanation": "Bandage contact lenses can be used in situations where the corneal surface requires protection from mechanical forces (such as trichiasis or entropion) or from eyelid movement over the exposed area; the bandage contact lenses can be used to promote healing and pain relief (i.e., from a corneal abrasion) and to improve vision while maintaining binocularity. In general, it is best to choose a silicone hydrogel for extended wear purposes that fits a little more steeply to reduce lens movement and mechanical friction (do not seal off the cornea-- some movement is required). &#10;&#10;A dellen is a paralimbal thinning of corneal tissue adjacent to elevated tissue. In general, a dellen can develop beside a pinguecula, pterygium, chemosis or scar tissue secondary to trauma or surgery. This condition arises from uneven tear film distribution, causing desiccation and thinning. If present for a long period of time, scar tissue may develop. &#10;&#10;Corneal arcus is commonly seen in the elderly as a bilateral yellow/white ring that encircles the cornea while maintaining a clear zone between itself and the limbus. The ring occurs due to lipid leakage from limbal blood vessels. Treatment is not generally required as vision is not affected. However, if the patient is under 50 years of age, consider systemic hyperlipidemia and refer for blood work. If the patient is under 40 years of age and presents with arcus, refer for a serum cholesterol measurement. Lastly, if the arcus is unilateral, consider carotid occlusion on the side that DOES NOT display corneal arcus. &#10;&#10;A limbal girdle of Vogt is located in the interpalpebral zone at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions of the cornea and comes in two types. The less common form leaves a clear zone between itself and the limbus and appears as a white/yellow band that remains in the peripheral cornea and is considered to be an early form of band keratopathy. The second form is contiguous with the conjunctiva and may be mistaken for a pinguecula, because there is no clear zone between itself and the limbus. The white-yellow band occurs as a result of collagen breakdown in Bowman's layer. No treatment is necessary.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Corneal Epithelial Wound Healing"

      "explanation": "Epithelial ingrowth tends to develop several days to weeks post-LASIK and initially presents along the flap edge interface. This condition is caused by the proliferation of surface epithelial cells into the corneal flap interface. Ingrowth is more commonly encountered after enhancement surgeries, particularly if more than two years have passed since the original surgery date. Risk factors for ingrowth are increased for patients who are slightly older, those with epithelial basement membrane dystrophy, those with a history of recurrent corneal erosions, those who frequently rub their eyes, diabetic patients, and those with blepharospasm."

      "answers": [" Total Pachymetry, minus the flap thickness, minus the ablation depth, should be at least 250 microns   "],
      "explanation": "Laser vision correction removes tissue from the cornea however at some point the structure of the cornea is adversely affected by having too little tissue remaining. While there have not been any studies that point to a specific depth at which most corneas become at risk, the FDA has set a minimum limit of 250 microns of thickness for the corneal bed. To calculate that thickness, a doctor takes the thinnest corneal pachymetry measurement and subtracts the thickness of the proposed corneal flap as well as the thickness of the ablation. The thickness of the ablation increases with increased refractive error and increased higher order aberrations therefore greater refractive errors require the ablation of more tissue."

      ],
      "answers": [" Add a -1.00 lens and subtract 6D from the drum reading   "],
      "explanation": "When measuring the keratometry values utilizing a manual keratometer, there are certain circumstances in which the reading may be out of the range of the drum values. In these cases, one will need to add a trial lens to keratometer in order to extend the ranges (lenses are added to the patient's side of the keratometer). Cases in which the curvature is steeper than the drum reading, plus trial lenses are required, and when the reading is flatter than the drum reading, minus trial lenses are necessary. &#10;In the case of steeper curvatures, typically a +1.25 trial lens is tried first. If a measurement can be found with this lens, one will need to add about 8-9D to the drum reading in order to obtain the true value. A +1.25 lens will extend the range from about 52D to 60 or 61D. &#10;If keratometry values are even steeper (in the 60-68D range), a +2.25 trial lens can be utilized to extend the drum range even more. In these cases, about 16D is added to the drum reading to reach the true keratometry value. &#10;If the curvature is flatter than can be measured with the manual keratometer, a minus lens can be added to extend the range in the opposite direction. Typically a -1.00 trial lens will encompass a keratometry reading from about 32-38D. If a -1.00 lens is added, one will need to subtract 6D from the drum reading. This is the case for the above patient."

      "explanation": "The most common reason for reduced uncorrected visual acuity on the one-day post operative visit is dry eye. The goblet cells may be damaged during the procedure and there may also be mechanical damage to the corneal epithelium. Central corneal staining is often seen at the one-day post operative visit. Also, a patient may have over- or under-responded to the treatment. It is best to determine the refractive error of a patient by performing retinoscopy, because this test allows the clinician to also determine if straie or irregular astigmatism could be causing the decrease in vision. Visual acuity can vary greatly during the first week after surgery, so a final determination of the patient's vision cannot be made and glasses are premature at this time."

      "question": "Which type of refractive surgery utilizes radiofrequency energy?",

      "answers": [" Conductive keratoplasty (CK)   "],
      "explanation": "Conductive keratoplasty is a type of refractive surgery that is used in the treatment of low amounts of hyperopia (+0.75 to +3.00 D with less than 0.75 D of astigmatism). A thin probe is inserted into the peripheral cornea at specified intervals which delivers radiofrequency energy, causing a shrinking of the surrounding collagen. The circular ring of altered collagen results in a steepening of the central cornea and thus a decrease in hyperopia. The results of CK are temporary and generally do not last more than a few years. The surgery can be repeated. &#10;&#10;Laser thermal keratoplasty (LTK) is also a surgery that is targeted towards presbyopes with low amounts of hyperopia and astigmatism. This procedure utilizes a holmium laser to cause shrinkage of the peripheral corneal collagen, resulting in corneal steepening. Again, LTK is temporary and will generally revert in roughly two to three years. &#10;&#10;Photo-refractive keratectomy (PRK) requires the use of an excimer laser to ablate the corneal epithelium and then refine the underlying tissue. PRK has been used for thin corneas and can eliminate up to roughly 7.00 D of myopia. There are varying levels of discomfort associated with this procedure, and it entails a visual recovery period of two to three weeks. During this time the cornea re-epithelializes. PRK usually requires the use of a bandage contact lens during the immediate recovery period. &#10;&#10;Radial Keratotomy was quite a popular procedure prior to LASIK. This surgery was used to eliminate low amounts of myopia and astigmatism by flattening the cornea via the creation of radial incisions. A hand-held scalpel was used to generate 4-8 cuts (or more). Unfortunately, the results were variable due to lack of precision and reproducibility of incision depth and unpredictable healing effects. RK also requires a long recovery time and can be quite uncomfortable. &#10;&#10;LASIK also utilizes a laser to alter the corneal topography. Past LASIK procedures utilized a microkeratome to cut a flap and expose the underlying corneal stroma for sculpting. It is now more common for the flap to be created by a laser, which provides greater precision and reproducibility of incision depth. Reportedly, LASIK can be used to correct up to 12.00 D of myopia, 6.00 D of astigmatism and 6.00 D of hyperopia. LASIK is currently the refractive procedure of choice due to its good results, increased reliability, quick recovery time and decreased level of discomfort when compared to other refractive surgeries."

      "answers": [" Atmospheric oxygen   "],
      "explanation": "Tears absorb oxygen from the air which then diffuses into the cornea. Oxygen is required by the endothelium and the epithelium because they are metabolically active. A small amount of oxygen is also supplied by the limbal blood vessels and by diffusion from the aqueous. However, due to the large amount of oxygen required by the cornea, most of the oxygen during periods of wakefulness is derived from the tears. For this reason, it is important that contact lens patients be fitted with lenses that offer high oxygen permeability."

      "explanation": "The epithelial stem cells are located within the palisades of Vogt. These white, linear structures traverse radially around the cornea and are more prominent inferiorly than superiorly. They are clearly evident right on the edge of the limbus and extend to blend invisibly with the cornea. The palisades serve as housing for blood vessels, nerves, connective tissue and lymphatics. Most importantly, the palisades have been proven to contain stem cells that can be stimulated for renewal of aging/damaged epithelial cells. Axenfeld loops are generally seen in the sclera as sometimes raised areas of pigment. These loops are formed by nerves that initially course one way and then turn back on themselves. Goblet cells secrete the mucous layer of the tear film and are found primarily in the conjunctiva."

      "explanation": "Following minor corneal injuries, the main concern is for the cornea to seal off the wound and form tight junctions as quickly as possible to prevent edema and infection. The first phase following an abrasion is the sloughing off of superficial cells at the wound margin. This is followed by a flattening of basal cells surrounding the wound which then move into the damaged area via filpodia (extensions that allow for amoeboid-type motion). Mitosis rates increase surrounding the injury site to replace those cells that have migrated. The basal cells then secrete fibronectin and laminin to achieve transitory cellular attachment until the formation of hemidesmosomes. Once a basal cell comes in contact with another basal cell, a hemidesmosome forms signaling for a decrease in mitosis.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Corneal Epithelial Wound Healing"

      "answers": [" Endothelium   "],
      "explanation": "The cells of the endothelium require the greatest amount of oxygen. This is due to the fact that endothelial cells maintain a steady state of corneal clarity and hydration. They actively pump out ions into the anterior chamber which sets up an osmotic gradient, causing water to flow down its concentration gradient, thus preventing corneal swelling and opacification. However, because the endothelium is only one layer thick, in total this layer consumes 21% of the oxygen provided to the cornea. The stroma utilizes 39% of oxygen made available to the cornea, but this is a low consumption rate considering that it makes up the bulk of the cornea. The epithelium is responsible for 40% of the oxygen consumed by the cornea. However, all else being equal, the endothelial cells consume the greatest amount of oxygen (140 X 10-5 ml of oxygen per sec.) vs. stromal cells (2.85 X 10-5 ml of oxygen/sec.) and epithelial cells (26.5 X 10-5 ml of oxygen/sec.)."

Bandage contact lenses may be used to promote corneal epithelial healing in cases where an epithelial defect persists (abrasion or recurrent corneal erosion), as the lens acts to protect the epithelium from the rubbing action of the eyelids, allowing the hemidesmosomes to create a strong attachment to the basement membrane. &#10;&#10;In addition to promoting corneal healing, bandage contact lenses are also commonly utilized for pain relief in certain conditions such as bullous keratopathy, Thygeson's superficial keratitis, filamentary keratitis, and trichiasis. The bandage contact lens relieves pain by protecting exposed corneal nerves from the shearing forces of the eyelids during blinking or via mechanical protection of the cornea from inwardly turned eyelashes. &#10;&#10;Bandage contact lenses are also used post-surgically in all cases of photorefractive keratoplasty (PRK) to allow healing of the corneal epithelium that has undergone the surgical procedure. Contact lenses are not typically applied after LASIK surgery unless there has been a serious complication."

      "options": [" Cardiac arrhythmias  ", " Cancer  ", " Hypertension  ", " Rheumatoid arthritis   ", " Diabetes  "],
      "answers": [" Rheumatoid arthritis   "],
      "explanation": "Gold salts are used to manage rheumatoid arthritis, primarily when other treatment options have failed. Chrysiasis occurs secondary to the deposition of gold in the skin, lens, and cornea, causing a gray discoloration of the skin and brown/gold deposits in the deep stroma of the cornea. &#10;&#10;Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic medication. Use of this drug commonly causes yellow/brown or white powdery corneal epithelial deposits located inferocentrally that appear to swirl outward while sparing the limbus. These deposits affect visual acuity minimally, if at all. The aforementioned deposits can also be observed in Fabry's disease and in patients taking tamoxifen, chlorpromazine, chloroquine, or indomethacin."

      "question": "A 10-year old child presents in your office with a unilateral follicular conjunctivitis along with ipsilateral adenopathy. You correctly diagnose oculoglandular syndrome. Because it is the most common etiology, which of the following causes are you MOST likely to suspect?",
      "options": [" Cat-scratch disease   ", " Toxoplasmosis  ", " Measles  ", " Diabetes  ", " Coccidioidomycosis  "],
      "answers": [" Cat-scratch disease   "],
      "explanation": "Oculoglandular syndrome can be caused by a myriad of organisms and presents as a unilateral follicular conjunctivitis along with lymphadenopathy on the same side as the affected eye. Other signs and symptomology vary depending on the causative organism. Causes include but are not limited to: cat-scratch disease, tularemia, syphilis, tuberculosis, sprotrichosis, mononucleosis, coccidioidomycosis, sarcoidosis, Hansen's disease, mumps, actinomycosis, Listeria and Herpes simplex. &#10;&#10;Based solely upon the age of the child, one would first assume cat-scratch disease, which is the most common cause of oculoglandular syndrome. This assumption would be verified by asking if the child had recently been scratched by a cat and by performing the Hanger-Rose skin test for confirmation. &#10;&#10;Coccidioidomycosis can cause oculoglandular syndrome, but it is contracted via exposure to a fungus that is found in soil and vegetables through an opening in the skin and is frequently encountered in gardeners, farm workers, or botanists. Children do not generally contract oculoglandular syndrome in this fashion. &#10;&#10;Diabetes, measles, and toxoplasmosis do not display a correlation with the development of oculoglandular syndrome. &#10;&#10;Reference: Holland, E.

      "explanation": "Polymegathism refers to a change in cell size. This occurs primarily to cells of the endothelium. When cells become larger, they can overlap and cause the appearance of larger and smaller cells when in reality all of the cells are actually enlarged due to long-term hypoxia. Pleomorphism can also occur in patients that wear contact lenses with low oxygen permeability. This condition entails an altering of cell shape of endothelial cells."

      "question": "A newborn presenting with symptoms of ophthalmia neonatorum 3 days after birth is MOST likely infected with which of the following organisms?",
      "options": [" Chlamydia trachomatis  ", " Neisseria gonorrhoeae   ", " Streptococcus pneumonia  ", " Haemophilus influenza  ", " Herpes simplex virus  ", " Staphylococcus aureus  "],
      "answers": [" Neisseria gonorrhoeae   "],
      "explanation": "Ophthalmia neonatorum is a conjunctivitis that typically develops within the first 3 weeks after birth as a result of transmission of infection from mother to child during delivery. This condition is particularly serious due to the lack of immunity in infants as well as the immaturity of the ocular surface (poor tear film and undeveloped lymphoid tissue). &#10;&#10;Ophthalmia neonatorum secondary to N. gonorrhoeae typically develops within 2-5 days postpartum as hyperacute conjunctivitis. Most cases present bilaterally with periorbital edema, conjunctival chemosis, and excessive amounts of purulent discharge. It is extremely important to quickly and aggressively treat this infection due to the ability of N. gonorrhoeae to penetrate an intact corneal epithelium. &#10;&#10;When C. trachomatis is the organism responsible for ophthalmia neonatorum, mild to moderate symptoms of unilateral or bilateral conjunctivitis commonly occur between 5 to 14 days after birth. C. trachomatis is the most common cause of ophthalmia neonatorum. These patients present with lid edema, conjunctival chemosis, punctate corneal opacities, and occasionally micropannus formation. &#10;&#10;Other etiologies of ophthalmia neonatorum can include S. aureus, Haemophilus species, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa. These pathogens are part of the normal bacterial flora of the female genital tract and are likely acquired as the newborn travels through the birth canal."

      "question": "A 52-year old male is seen at your office complaining of red, irritated, and burning eyes. He has been using over-the-counter redness reliever drops every half an hour for two days but he feels as if his eyes have gotten worse. He initially started using the drops because his eyes were mildly itchy. Biomicroscopy reveals bilateral corneal superficial punctate keratitis (SPK) and 2+ injection of the conjunctiva. Based upon the above information, which of the following is the BEST diagnosis for his current condition?",
      "options": [" Chrysiasis  ", " Dry eye syndrome  ", " Medicamentosa   ", " Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC)  "],
      "answers": [" Medicamentosa   "],
      "explanation": "Medicamentosa refers to the situation in which a patient reacts to medication or the preservatives contained within an ophthalmic preparation. Symptoms include pain, foreign body sensation, burning, and photophobia, depending on the severity. Ocular signs include conjunctival injection, SPK, chemosis, and ulceration, and scarring in very severe cases. Treatment includes discontinuation of the offending agent and management of the inflammation with preservative-free ocular lubricants and topical steroids if necessary. &#10;&#10;Dry eye syndrome may have been a factor initially, but because this patient states that his eyes got worse when he started using the drops, one can presume that this is attributable to his extreme overuse of over-the-counter ophthalmic drops. &#10;&#10;Gold salts are used to manage rheumatoid arthritis, primarily when other treatment options have failed. Chrysiasis occurs secondary to the deposition of gold in the skin, lens, and cornea, causing a gray discoloration of the skin and brown/gold deposits in the deep stroma of the cornea. &#10;&#10;VKC is a condition of the young and presents with an increased frequency in males. This type of allergy typically develops before age 14 and lasts for 4-10 years before the child outgrows it; it occurs predominantly in the spring and summer. The condition progressively gets better, with the first episode being the worst. Usually VKC is seen in patients who are prone to atopy; they typically suffer from eczema, asthma, or hay fever as well as itchy eyes and photophobia. The condition basically presents as a very severe type of allergic conjunctivitis. Signs include cobblestone papillae of the upper lid, lid swelling, and ropy discharge that is worse in the morning. Corneal defects (usually superiorly) known as keratitis of Togby may also be present. Occasionally, patients will develop a shield ulcer and Tranta's dots which are calcified eosinophils seen circumlimbally (they appear as chalky concretions) which may lead to the feeling of an associated foreign body sensation. Treatment includes mast cell stabilizers (these should be started several weeks prior to re-occurring episodes), pulse steroid therapy, cool compresses, and sunglasses to help alleviate ensuing photophobia."

      "answers": [" Collagen   "],
      "explanation": "Collagen provides the basic structural framework of connective tissue throughout the body. In the cornea, collagens are responsible for establishing the transparency of the corneal tissue as well providing tensile strength. Of all of the components of the cornea, collagen makes up over 70% of the cornea's dry weight, keratocytes provide 10%, proteoglycans 9%, and other components comprise the last 10%. Of the 13 different types of collagen in the human cornea, the most common collagen molecule is type 1."

      "answers": [" Bitot spots   "],
      "explanation": "Vitamin A deficiency can lead to the loss of goblet cells, resulting in dryness of the conjunctiva and eventual keratinization in severe cases. Bitot spots are triangular patches that represent keratinized conjunctival epithelium. They have a foamy appearance and typically occur in the interpalpebral zone. &#10;&#10;Tranta's dots are discrete white spots that are found at the apices of limbal papillae associated with vernal keratoconjunctivitis. &#10;&#10;Roth's spots are retinal hemorrhages that have whitish centers. They are commonly observed in association with certain systemic conditions such as bacterial endocarditis, leukemia, diabetes, and pernicious anemia. &#10;&#10;Herbert's pits are depressed, round, thin areas that are the result of resolved limbal follicles in trachoma disease. &#10;&#10;Concretions are common observations that appear as small, chalky, whitish-yellow deposits typically found in the inferior tarsal and fornical conjunctiva. They frequently occur in association with meibomian gland disease."

      "question": "Diurnal refractive fluctuations are MOST likely to be experienced by a patient who has undergone which of the following procedures?",
      "options": [" Conductive keratoplasty (CK)  ", " Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK)  ", " Laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK)  ", " Radial keratotomy (RK)   "],
      "answers": [" Radial keratotomy (RK)   "],
      "explanation": "Radial keratotomy is performed by creating corneal incisions in a radial fashion, which serves to flatten the cornea, thereby decreasing the amount of myopia. However, many post-RK patients experience irregular astigmatism, dry eyes, and diurnal refractive error fluctuation. Studies have suggested that post RK patients suffer from unstable refractive errors secondary to normal variations in intraocular pressure (IOP) that typically occur throughout the day. Because the structure of the cornea has been surgically weakened, it is more susceptible to refractive instability due to an inability to compensate for IOP fluctuations. Treatment options include hard and soft contact lenses, hybrid lenses, several pairs of glasses with different prescriptions depending on refractive error and time of day, and suturing of RK incisions and lasso suture (circular suture that parallels the limbus to help stabilize the cornea). Other treatment options include the pharmaceutical use of brimonidine (off-label), which causes pupil miosis and helps to relieve glare and haloes, corneal cross-linking to help stabilize the cornea, and controlling IOP fluctuations via the use of topical prostaglandins (off-label). &#10;&#10;Patients who have undergone LASIK, PRK and CK are much less likely to experience refractive variability throughout the day. &#10;&#10;References: &#10;&#10;Cataract Surgery from Routine to Complex: A Practical Guide.

      "question": "Which biomicroscopy illumination technique does NOT require the use of the oculars to evaluate for corneal abnormalities such as central corneal clouding?",
      "options": [" Conical beam  ", " Diffuse illumination  ", " Sclerotic scatter   ", " Specular reflection  ", " Optic section  "],
      "answers": [" Sclerotic scatter   "],
      "explanation": "Sclerotic scatter is achieved by placing the illumination system at an angle of roughly 60 degrees from the oculars, positioned to illuminate the temporal limbus with a parallelepiped of roughly 1 mm in width. The examiner then observes the cornea outside of the oculars for signs of corneal abnormalities, such as central corneal clouding. &#10;&#10;An optic section is achieved by setting the beam width on the biomicroscope to roughly 0.5 mm. The illumination system is then placed at an angle from the oculars that permits one to effectively 'slice' the cornea into its constituent layers, allowing for depth localization. An optic section is also used to determine angle estimation. &#10;&#10;Diffuse illumination is accomplished by increasing the aperture size to greater than 4 mm in width, allowing for gross estimation of structures such as the lids, lashes, and conjunctiva. &#10;&#10;A conical beam is an illumination technique used to assess the anterior chamber for possible cells and flare seen secondary to an inflammatory reaction. A conical beam is achieved by making the aperture width and height of the light housing as small as possible and shifting the focus back and forth between the lens and the cornea to assess the anterior chamber. The illumination system should be set at an angle from the oculars. In order to maximize visibility, it is important to turn off all other sources of light in the examination room, and the examiner should be dark-adapted. &#10;&#10;Specular reflection is used to evaluate the quality of a surface such as the corneal endothelium or tear film. This type of illumination is achieved by placing the light housing in the straight ahead position and moving the oculars so that they create an angle of 45 degrees with the illumination system. The beam width should be about 1 mm. The achieved image will be observable through only one ocular at a time."

      "question": "Your 37 year-old male patient with a previous history of basement membrane disease reports that he began experiencing severe pain, watering, and photophobia upon wakening. Slit-lamp examination reveals a large epithelial defect in the interpalpebral zone that stains with sodium fluorescein. What is the MOST likely diagnosis of this patient?",
      "options": [" Corneal abrasion  ", " Corneal laceration  ", " Corneal erosion   ", " Corneal ulcer  "],
      "answers": [" Corneal erosion   "],
      "explanation": "Recurrent corneal erosions occur secondary to an abnormally weak attachment between the basal cells of the corneal endothelium and their basement membrane. Symptoms most commonly occur upon wakening, in which minor injuring resulting from opening the eyes after sleep causes shearing forces that are sufficient enough to tear the corneal epithelium. Patients typically present with severe ocular pain, watering, and photophobia that occurs during the night or shortly after wakening. There is usually a history of prior trauma or surgery (that could have occurred several years prior), or in association with an epithelial membrane dystrophy or anterior stromal dystrophy. Slit-lamp examination of these patients will usually reveal a frank epithelial defect, particularly in the interpalpebral zone or lower half of the cornea. There may also be a larger area surrounding the epithelial defect that represents the extent of the loose epithelium and may be highlighted with pooling of sodium fluorescein."

      "answers": [" Corneal endothelium   "],
      "explanation": "Because the cornea is immunologically privileged (does not have a blood supply), a normal cornea will not usually reject a graft; however, once there is inflammation in the cornea, this characteristic is lost. Graft rejection can occur in any layer of the cornea following a penetrating keratoplasty, but the most common layer that exhibits rejection is the corneal endothelium. Not only is this the most common site for rejection, but it is also the most severe type of corneal graft rejection, as it can result in severe loss of endothelial cells, leading to decompensation of the entire corneal structure. Rejection of the corneal stroma and epithelium is much less frequent and tends to respond well to topical corticosteroid treatment. It is important to note that graft rejection can occur at anytime following surgery, even several years post-operatively. Graft rejection is less common in cases of lamellar keratoplasty."

Typically, staining that occurs on the inferior portion of the cornea and conjunctiva is due to incomplete closure of the eyelids, leading to exposure of the inferior portion of the eye. Additionally, blepharitis can lead to staining of the cornea and conjunctiva in the area where the eyelid rests against the eye. Interpalpebral staining is common in patients with aqueous deficiency, and superior conjunctival staining is observed in cases of superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis.

He can barely open his right eye and reports that the pain began this morning when he first opened his eyes. His medical history is unremarkable, and he does not wear contact lenses. His ocular history is remarkable for a mild corneal abrasion of the right eye from a tree branch that occurred over a month ago but had since healed. Biomicroscopy (after instillation of a topical anesthetic) reveals an epithelial defect 1.5 mm wide and 1.0 mm long that stains with sodium fluorescein. There is no anterior chamber reaction and no visible discharge. What is the MOST appropriate diagnosis?",
      "options": [" Corneal ulcer (microbial keratitis)  ", " Recurrent corneal erosion   ", " Corneal abrasion  ", " Epithelial basement membrane dystrophy  "],
      "answers": [" Recurrent corneal erosion   "],
      "explanation": "This patient is suffering from a recurrent corneal erosion. These types of corneal defects frequently occur in response to a corneal abrasion incurred by something organic (like a fingernail or a tree branch). The initial abrasion heals, but a short time afterwards the patient will experience another episode without any incidence of trauma. The second occurrence tends to transpire first thing in the morning as the eyelids stick to that unstable flap of tissue overnight and rip it off like a band-aid when the eyes open. The best way to treat a recurrent corneal erosion is through the use of a topical antibiotic (unpreserved is best) to ensure sterility (as the cornea is exposed) as well as a bandage contact lens to speed up the healing process if the area of erosion is large. Hyperosmotic drops or artificial tears (preservative-free of course) should be prescribed for roughly 6-8 weeks (sometimes longer) to ensure healing and to allow for proper formation of hemidesmosomes that will help to alleviate future episodes. Other treatments include stromal micropuncture, debridement, phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), or oral tetracycline, which inhibits matrix metalloproteinases and allows for proper corneal healing. &#10;&#10;A corneal abrasion occurs secondary to some type of trauma or injury, and this was not the case in the above example. Recurrent corneal erosions are a common occurrence with epithelial basement membrane dystrophies, but that is not the resultant diagnosis of the current problem experienced by the patient. An ulcer is ruled out on the basis that there is no active infection and is unlikely, as these more commonly occur in patients who wear contact lenses."

      "answers": [" Endothelium   "],
      "explanation": "From superficial to deep, the layers of the cornea are: epithelium, Bowman's layer, substantia propria (stroma), Descemet's membrane, endothelium. The epithelial layer consists of squamous cells that occupy the superficial position transitioning to wing cells and then basal cells. Bowman's layer is a sheet of dense collagen that serves as a transition to the substantia propria (stroma) which is composed of collagen, keratocytes (fibroblastic cells), and ground substance. Descemet's membrane is considered the basement membrane for the endothelium. The corneal endothelium is adjacent to the anterior chamber and is a single flattened layer of cells that form tight junctional complexes and serves as a mechanism to control corneal thickness. Endothelial cells do not replicate. &#10;&#10;Ref: Remington, LA. Clinical Anatomy of the Visual System, 1998 p 11-19"

      "answers": [" Hay fever   "],
      "explanation": "There appears to be a very high correlation between keratoconus and atopy. People who suffer from eczema, allergies, and hay fever tend to display a higher incidence of keratoconus than the rest of the general population. Again, this subset of people has a tendency to rub their eye associated with ocular irritation, which may contribute to the formation of keratoconus. Keratoconus does appear to be linked with eye rubbing although whether this is a cause or simply a symptom is unclear at this point. According to the collaborative longitudinal evaluation of keratoconus study (CLEK), 53% of the patients with keratoconus reported suffering from hay fever or allergies. &#10;&#10;Keratoconus has also been associated with various ocular diseases including posterior polymorphous dystrophy, vernal conjunctivitis, floppy eyelid syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa, and Leber's congenital amaurosis. &#10;&#10;Reference: Vander, J., and Gault, J.

      "answers": [" Discomfort for 1-3 days after surgery   "],
      "explanation": "PRK surgery removes the epithelium prior to the delivery of the excimer laser. Therefore, there is no creation of a corneal flap. Because the epithelium is removed, the patient may experience pain and discomfort for the immediate post-operative period while the epithelium heals. During this time the vision is usually blurry. Epithelial ingrowth and diffuse lamellar keratitis both are conditions only seen when there is a corneal flap."

      ],
      "answers": [" Distance between collagen fibrils must be less than 1/2 the wavelength of visible light  "],
      "explanation": "The transparency of the cornea is due to the precise arrangement of the sheets of collagen fibrils that makeup the corneal stroma. Because of this configuration, light that is scattered by individual collagen fibrils is cancelled by destructive interference with light scattered by adjacent collagen fibrils. Therefore, light ends up only being scattered in the forward direction; this allows the cornea to remain transparent. In order for this type of destructive interference to occur, a few factors must be maintained. The diameter of the collagen fibrils must be of equal diameter, and each fibril must be equidistant from adjacent fibrils. Additionally, it is required that the distance between each collagen fibril must be less than the wavelength of visible light. When this arrangement is compromised (i.e. in an edematous cornea), the corneal stroma will swell, leading to loss of clarity due to the increase in distance between the collagen fibrils. Proteoglycans within the corneal stroma are responsible for preserving the regular packing and spacing of the fibrils, maintaining the transparency of this tissue."

      "answers": [" Increased systemic phosphorus levels   "],
      "explanation": "Calcific band keratopathy occurs in the interpalpebral region of the superficial cornea (particularly Bowman's membrane) and appears as white/hazy calcium ions that deposit in a Swiss cheese-like fashion. Common patient complaints with this condition include decreased vision and foreign body sensation. Treatment includes application of disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) under corneal anesthesia to chelate the calcium, which is then gently scraped off of the cornea. The procedure is repeated until the calcium is eliminated. A bandage contact lens and topical antibiotics are then prescribed to promote healing and sterility. Calcific band keratopathy can occur secondarily to chronic dry eye, exposure keratopathy, and chronic ocular inflammation such as uveitis or iritis, in a person with a history of multiple ocular surgeries or ocular trauma, and longstanding glaucoma. Systemic causes include hypercalcemia (which can occur in hyperparathyroidism), sarcoidosis, or vitamin D toxicity. Elevated phosphorus levels such as in cases of chronic renal failure are associated with this condition as well. Chronic exposure to ocular irritants such as mercury vapors or ophthalmic solutions that contain mercurial preservatives may also cause calcific band keratopathy, although the incidence of this etiology has been greatly reduced with increased knowledge and technological expertise."

      "question": "A 10-year old male is seen at your office complaining of itchy eyes and severe photophobia. He has a history of eczema and hay fever. Biomicroscopy reveals bilateral cobblestone papillae of the superior eyelids, ropy discharge, and mild superior corneal disruption that stains with sodium fluorescein. Given the above findings, what is your diagnosis?",

      "answers": [" Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC)   "],
      "explanation": "VKC is a condition of the young and presents with an increased frequency in males. This type of allergy typically develops before age 14 and lasts for 4-10 years before the child outgrows it; VKC occurs predominantly in the spring and summer. The condition progressively lessens in severity, with the first episode being the worst. Usually VKC is seen in patients who are prone to atopy; therefore they suffer from eczema, asthma, or hay fever. Patients typically suffer from itchy eyes and photophobia. The condition basically presents as a very severe type of allergic conjunctivitis. Signs include cobblestone papillae of the upper lid, lid swelling, and ropy discharge that is worse in the morning. Corneal defects (usually superiorly) known as keratitis of Togby may also be present. Occasionally, patients will develop a shield ulcer and Trantas' dots (calcified eosinophils seen circumlimbally that appear as chalky concretions), which may lead to the feeling of an associated foreign body sensation. Treatment includes mast cell stabilizers that should be started several weeks prior to re-occurring episodes, pulse steroid therapy, cool compresses, and sunglasses to help alleviate ensuing photophobia. &#10;&#10;EKC and bacterial conjunctivitis typically do not cause extreme itching and should not present with cobblestone papillae. &#10;&#10;The number one symptom associated with iritis is photophobia, and the patient should be neither complaining of itching nor have cobblestone papillae present on biomicroscopy."

Biomicroscopy reveals palpebral conjunctival follicles inferiorly along with mild eyelid edema and bilateral tender pre-auricular nodes. The cornea does not reveal any epithelial defects. He states that his co-worker had this same condition a week ago. Which of the following is the BEST diagnosis?",
      "options": [" Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis   ", " Phlyctenulosis  ", " Bacterial conjunctivitis  ", " Vernal conjunctivitis  "],
      "answers": [" Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis   "],
      "explanation": "Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is a very common and contagious infection of viral etiology. EKC is caused by the adenovirus, of which there are many different strains, but the most common to cause ocular infections are serotypes 8 and 19. EKC is said to follow the 'rule of 8s' because type 8 is the type most frequently isolated, on the 8th day the patient will present with diffuse superficial punctate keratitis (SPK), followed 8 days later (16 days from inoculation) by the formation of sub-epithelial infiltrates (SEIs). Once SEIs are present, the patient is no longer considered contagious. Signs of EKC include follicular conjunctivitis, positive lymphadenopathy, and mild lid edema. Small sub-conjunctival hemorrhages, pseudo-membranes, and iritis may also be present. Treatment for this condition is generally palliative and consists of ocular lubrication, topical vasoconstrictors, cool or warm compresses, topical NSAIDs, and sunglasses. Some clinicians use a Betadine® (5%) ophthalmic solution off-label treatment in office, which seems to work rather well. The use of steroids is still controversial because EKC and the Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can initially present similarly, and steroid use on HSV can lead to horrendous corneal damage. Topical steroids are very effective if the patient suffers from SEIs that are visually debilitating but be sure to taper the steroid use. &#10;&#10;Vernal conjunctivitis is a severe form of allergic conjunctivitis and is generally observed in young male patients who suffer from some form of atopy like eczema, asthma, or hay fever. The patient will complain of itching as their main symptom. Pre-auricular nodes will not be affected in this condition. &#10;&#10;Bacterial conjunctivitis usually presents in one eye first and then the other eye becomes infected via self-inoculation. This condition is contagious and is easily spread to other individuals in office settings, child-care facilities, or other institutions due to a lack of hand washing. Bacterial conjunctivitis usually causes a mucopurulent discharge (depending on the causative organism) and will not affect the pre-auricular nodes. Hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis caused by N. gonorrhoeae will cause swelling of the pre-auricular nodes. &#10;&#10;Phlyctenulosis is caused by a hypersensitive reaction to either microbes or their by-products, most commonly Staphylococcus exotoxins. This condition presents as a pink elevated nodule of tissue either on the conjunctiva or encroaching from the conjunctiva onto the cornea. Patients with phlyctenules will complain of pain and irritation, but their pre-auricular nodes will remain un-involved."

      "answers": [" Endothelium   "],
      "explanation": "The cells of the endothelium require the greatest amount of oxygen. This is due to the fact that endothelial cells maintain a steady state of corneal clarity and hydration. They actively pump out ions into the anterior chamber, which sets up an osmotic gradient that causes water to flow down its concentration gradient, thus preventing corneal swelling and opacification. However, because the endothelium is only one layer thick, in total this layer consumes 21% of the oxygen provided to the cornea. The stroma utilizes 39% of oxygen made available to the cornea, which is a low consumption rate considering that it makes up the bulk of the cornea. The epithelium is responsible for 40% of the oxygen consumed by the cornea. However, all else being equal, the endothelial cells consume the greatest amount of oxygen (140 X 10-5 ml of oxygen per sec), vs. stromal cells (2.85 X 10-5 ml of O2/sec) and epithelial cells (26.5 X 10-5 ml of O2/sec)."

This is best seen with the slit lamp and will present as punctate areas of endothelial cell loss. If too many cells are lost Fuch's dystrophy or bullous keratopathy can occur resulting in corneal edema and painful stromal vacuoles. If the vision loss due to endothelial decompensation is severe, a corneal transplant is required to restore visual function."

      "explanation": "Contact lenses of all types can have an effect on a patient's tear film, corneal topography, and refractive error. Therefore, it is important to have a patient discontinue wear of their contact lenses for a certain timeframe prior to surgery. The FDA requires patients to be out of soft contact lenses for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to any customized procedure. Because rigid gas-permeable lenses can have a more dramatic effect on corneal topography and thus on refractive error, they require a longer time for the cornea to normalize. The FDA requirement is a minimum of 1 month with the recommendation of 1 month for every decade of wear or until the corneal topography is stable."

      "explanation": "There are three different surgical procedures indicated for the necessary removal of an eye. These include evisceration, enucleation, and exteneration. &#10;- Evisceration is the removal of the iris, cornea, and internal contents of the eye, leaving the sclera and attached extraocular muscles intact. &#10;- Enucleation is the removal of the entire eyeball, leaving the eyelids and the adjacent structures intact. &#10;- Exteneration involves the removal of the entire contents of the eye socket, including the eyeball and adjacent fat, muscles, and other nearby structures. In certain cases, the eyelids and the maxilla may also be removed."

      "question": "Which of the following conditions occurs as a result from changes to Descemet's membrane?",
      "options": [" Fleck dystrophy  ", " Reis-Buckler's dystrophy  ", " Posterior polymorphous dystrophy   ", " Lattice dystrophy type I  "],
      "answers": [" Posterior polymorphous dystrophy   "],
      "explanation": "Posterior polymorphous dystrophy appears as gray/white vesicles or rings within Descemet's membrane, often described as a 'railroad track'. The condition is generally bilateral, asymmetrical, and very slowly progressive. Most patients are asymptomatic and do not require treatment. There is a small chance that these patients will develop glaucoma due to the formation of peripheral anterior synechia, which may block the trabecular meshwork. If severe corneal decompensation occurs (which is quite rare), the patient may require a corneal transplant. &#10;&#10;Reis-Buckler's dystrophy is limited to Bowman's layer and has an onset within the first decade of life due to its autosomal dominance inheritance pattern. This condition reveals itself as sub-epithelial opacities in a ring-like, honeycomb, or fishnet pattern in the central to mid-peripheral cornea. The cornea can become hazy and the overlying epithelium may thicken, but the peripheral cornea is spared. People with this condition will likely suffer from recurrent corneal erosions and decreased vision. Management includes bandage contact lenses, phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), superficial keratectomy, or a corneal transplant. &#10;&#10;Fleck dystrophy is an autosomal dominant condition that has an onset in the first decade of life and occurs due to fleck or comma-like deposition of glycosaminoglycan in the stroma. This dystrophy rarely requires any intervention. &#10;&#10;Lattice dystrophy is an autosomal dominant dystrophy (except for type III, which is autosomal recessive) with four sub-types that are categorized according to age of onset, systemic involvement, causative mutation, and appearance. Essentially, this condition is due to the deposition of amyloid, causing a decrease in visual acuity. The opacifications in this dystrophy appear as thick or thin lines and dots (depending on the sub-type). &#10;&#10;Reference: Reinhard, T. and Larkin, F. Cornea and External Eye Disease vol.2 2008 page 95."

      "options": [
        " Fleischer's ring and Munson's signs are only found in pellucid marginal degeneration and are absent in cases of keratoconus  ",

      ],
      "answers": [" Central corneal thickness is usually reduced in keratoconus and normal in pellucid marginal degeneration   "],
      "explanation": "There are several differences in the clinical signs between pellucid marginal degeneration (PMD) and keratoconus (KCN) that aid in obtaining a correct diagnosis, as summarized below: &#10;- Best-corrected visual acuity typically becomes reduced in mild stages of KCN, while vision is usually maintained until the advanced stages in PMD. Therefore, loss of best-corrected vision with spectacles is typically much younger in KCN (puberty) as compared to PMD (4th to 5th generation). &#10;- The area of protrusion or ectasia in KCN corresponds to the area of thinning, which typically occurs centrally or just inferior to the visual axis. Corneal thinning in PMD is peripheral (usually inferiorly from 4-8 o'clock position), while the area of protrusion typically occurs superior to the zone of thinning. &#10;- Central corneal thickness in KCN is reduced compared to normal averages, while it tends to be within normal ranges in PMD. &#10;- The presence of Fleischer's ring, apical corneal scarring, and Munson's sign are usually found in moderate and severe stages of KCN and are absent in all cases of PMD."

      "explanation": "Wilson disease is a rare systemic condition (usually involving the liver) that results in widespread deposition of copper in the tissues of the body. Corneal deposits are present in almost all patients with this disease and present as a brownish or greenish tint that encircles the periphery of the cornea, with a preferential distribution in the vertical meridian.

      "answers": [" Irregular excrescences of Descemet's membrane   "],
      "explanation": "Corneal guttata are abnormal excrescences or bumps of Descemet's membrane that are secreted by anomalous corneal endothelial cells. Slit-lamp examination in patients with this finding will show a classic 'beaten metal' appearance, which is best viewed by specular reflection. Guttata typically present in the central cornea and seldom reach the periphery. Patients are not considered having Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy unless stromal and epithelial edema occurs in association with the finding of corneal guttata. When persistent epithelial edema produces the formation of microcysts and bullae, this is known as bullous keratopathy."

      "options": [" Generally located in the central cornea  ", " Usually inherited  ", " Usually symmetrical  ", " Usually a primary disorder  ", " Tends to be unilateral   "],
      "answers": [" Tends to be unilateral   "],
      "explanation": "Corneal degenerations in general present unilaterally, or if they are bilateral, they tend to be asymmetrical affecting the corneal periphery. The condition usually occurs secondary to some type of infection, insult, or trauma and results in a breakdown or deterioration of tissue. Degenerations can also result from aging, metabolic changes, or some type of secondary inflammatory disorder. Dystrophies, on the other hand, tend to be inherited and affect only one layer of the cornea. Dystrophies are usually bilateral, symmetrical, and are rarely associated with any systemic disease; generally, they manifest earlier on in life."

      "answers": [" Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC)   "],
      "explanation": "VKC is a condition of the young and presents with an increased frequency in males. This type of allergy typically develops before age 14 and lasts for 4-10 years before the child outgrows it. The condition occurs predominantly in the spring and summer. The condition progressively lessens in severity, with the first episode being the worst. Usually VKC is seen in patients who are prone to atopy; therefore, they suffer from eczema, asthma, or hay fever. Patients typically suffer from itchy eyes and photophobia. The condition basically presents as a very severe type of allergic conjunctivitis. Signs include cobblestone papillae of the upper lid, lid swelling, and ropy discharge that is worse in the morning. Corneal defects (usually superiorly) known as keratitis of Togby may also be present. Occasionally, patients will develop a shield ulcer and Trantas' spots (calcified eosinophils seen circumlimbally that appear as chalky concretions), which may lead to the feeling of an associated foreign body sensation. Treatment includes mast cell stabilizers that should be started several weeks prior to re-occurring episodes, pulse steroid therapy, cool compresses, and sunglasses to help alleviate ensuing photophobia."

      "options": [" Glutathione  ", " Alpha-tocopherol  ", " Ascorbic acid   ", " Reductase  ", " Catalase  "],
      "answers": [" Ascorbic acid   "],
      "explanation": "Ultraviolet radiation, violet light, and blue light exposure can potentially cause damage to certain structures of the eye through the generation of reactive oxygen species. These products can cause cellular and extracellular damage through reactions with DNA, proteins, and lipids. In healthy eyes, the cornea and anterior segment have naturally occurring methods to protect themselves from the potential deleterious effects of the reactive oxygen species. Most notably, the anterior segment produces and maintains sufficient levels of both low-molecular weight and high-molecular weight antioxidants. Ascorbic acid is considered to be the primary antioxidant present in the cornea and anterior segment, as it is produced in significantly high concentrations in the aqueous humor. In fact, the high amounts of ascorbic acid in the corneal epithelium are responsible for the complete absorption of UV-C and the significant attenuation of UV-A and UV-B light as it passes through the eye. &#10;&#10;Adler's Physiology of the Eye.

      "answers": [" Goblet cells   "],
      "explanation": "Although goblet cells are present in the conjunctiva, they do not appear at the limbus. The limbus does indeed contain melanocytes which frequently manifest as limbal melanonsis. Blood vessels are also present at the limbus, however they normally do not extend too far into the cornea. Langerhans cells are profuse within the limbus and serve as mediators of cellular immunity. These cells are found in much denser populations within the skin. Interestingly, corneal Langerhans cell numbers increase with contact lenses that are worn for extended periods. &#10;&#10;The limbus is also the location of a stem cell plexus. The function of the limbal stem cells is to prevent the growth of conjunctiva onto the cornea and to produce corneal epithelial cells."

      "answers": [" Lattice dystrophy   "],
      "explanation": "Lattice dystrophy is an autosomal dominant dystrophy (except for type III, which is autosomal recessive) with four sub-types categorized according to age of onset, systemic involvement, causative mutation, and appearance. Essentially, this condition is due to a deposition of amyloid that causes a decrease in visual acuity. The opacifications in this dystrophy appear as thick or thin lines and dots (depending on the sub-type). &#10;&#10;Granular dystrophy results from a deposition of eosinophilic hyaline in the anterior stroma. Again, this condition is autosomal dominant and onsets in the first decade of life. As time passes, the deposits tend to coalesce and cause a decrease in visual acuity. Granular dystrophy presents with a clear limbal zone. The stroma between the opacities remains clear in the early stages of the condition. &#10;&#10;Macular dystrophy occurs secondary to a deposition of glycosaminoglycans (mucopolysaccharides) in the stroma during the first decade of life. This condition is autosomal recessive and causes poor vision by the time the patient reaches roughly 20-30 years of age due to corneal thinning and enlargement of opacities that involves all of the corneal layers. This dystrophy extends to the limbus. The preferred surgical intervention is a corneal transplant. Macular dystrophy is the most visually devastating of the three stromal dystrophies mentioned here. &#10;&#10;A good mnemonic for committing this to memory is: Marilyn Monroe Got Hers in Los Angeles (Macular-Mucopolysaccharide, Granular-Hyaline, Lattice-Amyloid). &#10;&#10;Fleck dystrophy is an autosomal dominant condition that has an onset in the first decade of life and occurs due to fleck or comma-like deposition of glycosaminoglycan in the stroma.

      "answers": [" Corynebacterium diphtheriae   "],
      "explanation": "The formation of a true membrane in cases of acute membranous conjunctivitis is most commonly associated with a Corynebacterium diphtheria infection. Several other organisms can also cause membranous conjunctivitis (Strep hemolyticus, Strep pneumonia, N. gonorrhoeae, S. aureus, H. aegypticus, E. coli, adenoviruses, and herpes simplex); however, membranes are more or less synonymous with diphtheric conjunctivitis. &#10;&#10;The difference between a true membrane and pseudomembrane is that in a pseudomembrane, the coagulum is deposited on the surface of the epithelium, while true membranes infiltrate the superficial layers of the conjunctival epithelium. A pseudomembrane can typically be easily peeled off, leaving the epithelium intact; while attempted removal of a true membrane can lead to bleeding and tearing of the conjunctival epithelium."

      "answers": [" Keratocytes   "],
      "explanation": "The central cornea is generally devoid of blood vessels. To maintain clear vision and decrease light scatter it is important that the visual axis remain avascular. Because the central portion of the cornea is avascular, one should not expect to find hemoglobin since it is found within blood vessels. The cornea does contain many nerve endings, however the nerves are not myelinated when they extend to the central cornea because myelination would cause light scatter and decreased vision. Keratocytes are located in the central cornea to maintain and uphold collagen which is the main component of the stroma."

Additionally, following surgical procedures (mostly involving the anterior segment of the eye) such as photorefractive keratectomy or laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis, desensitization of the cornea is common due to the disruption of corneal nerves during the procedure. This decrease in corneal sensitivity (regardless of the etiology) is known as hypoesthesia. Following surgical injury, it is thought that it may take 3-12 months or longer for corneal innervation and sensitization to maximally recover, as nerve regeneration typically occurs at a rate of about 1mm per month. &#10;&#10;Hyperalgesia is an increase in sensitivity to pain. Hypoxia is a condition of tissues of the body in which the region is deprived of an adequate supply of oxygen. Lastly, hypercapnia is the condition of abnormally high levels of carbon dioxide levels in the blood."

      "question": "Your 39-year old male patient presents with a chief complaint of blurred vision in his right eye with his glasses, which, are 3 years old. Upon slit lamp examination, you notice that his nasal pterygium appears to have advanced further onto the cornea. Which of the following changes in his refractive error would you MOST likely expect to see?",

      "answers": [" Increase in with-the-rule astigmatism   "],
      "explanation": "The most common type of shift in refractive error in patients with an advancing pterygium is an increase in with-the-rule (WTR) astigmatism. The underlying cause of pterygium-induced WTR astigmatism is due to the exertion of tractional forces by the contractile elements of the corneal growth. Because pterygia typically grow from the nasal area horizontally onto the cornea, these forces will result in flattening of the horizontal meridian, thus producing more with-the-rule astigmatism."

      "answers": [" Hyperthyroidism   "],
      "explanation": "Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK) is predominantly found in middle-aged women that tend to have associated abnormal thyroid function (usually hyperthyroidism). Studies have shown a 50% prevalence of thyroid disease in patients diagnosed with SLK. The exact etiology and pathophysiology of SLK remains unclear, but the relation with hyperthyroidism and the pattern of exacerbations and remissions suggests a possible autoimmune association. It is thought that SLK occurs as a result of blink-related mechanical trauma that leads to irritation of the superior limbal region as loose conjunctival tissue rubs against the limbus during the blinking movement of the upper eyelids. Damage typically occurs to both the superior tarsal and conjunctival surfaces."

      "options": [" II  ", " I   ", " VI  ", " III  "],
      "answers": [" I   "],
      "explanation": "The first image is caused by reflection from the anterior corneal surface and is the brightest of the images. The first image is roughly the same size as the object. The second Purkinje image is formed by the posterior surface of the cornea and almost coincides with the first Purkinje image. The third Purkinje image is the largest and is caused by reflection off of the anterior plane of the crystalline lens. The fourth Purkinje image is the smallest and is inverted, formed by reflection off of the posterior surface of the lens. &#10;&#10;Purkinje image I serves a variety of clinical uses. This image is used to determine the radius of curvature of a given area of the cornea in keratometry. This image is also useful for determining corneal topography (i.e. Placido's Disk topographers), to perform the Hirschberg test in strabismic patients as well as to calculate the angle kappa when evaluating for eccentric fixation."

      "question": "One of your favorite patients returns to your office for her 1-day post-operative LASIK examination. She reports that she is in compliance with all of her eye drops, however her right eye is rather blurry and she may have accidentally rubbed it this morning. Biomicroscopy confirms your suspicion of a dislodged flap. What treatment should you recommend to the patient?",
      "options": [
        " Immediately refer the patient to the LASIK surgeon for flap re-positioning  ",
        " Prescribe another topical antibiotic and have the patient return in three days to ensure flap sterility  ",

      ],
      "answers": [" Immediately refer the patient to the LASIK surgeon for flap re-positioning  "],
      "explanation": "Whenever the flap is dislodged or possess large folds or wrinkles, the patient should immediately be referred back to the LASIK surgeon so that they may re-float and re-position the flap. Whatever you do, it is imperative that you DO NOT TOUCH THE FLAP! Any manipulation could further damage or tear the thin corneal tissue, increasing the chance of complications and poor future acuity. If possible, a shield should be placed over the involved eye without the use of pressure to protect the eye surface and the flap tissue. Always stress to the patient that they should absolutely not touch their eyes post-surgery to ensure that the flap heals properly."

      "options": [" Indirect illumination  ", " Direct illumination  ", " Specular reflection  ", " Scleral scatter  ", " Retroillumination   "],
      "answers": [" Retroillumination   "],
      "explanation": "The use of retroillumination with a slit-lamp biomicroscope is helpful in better visualizing fine corneal epithelial and endothelial changes, such as keratic precipitates, epithelial cysts, and small blood vessels. The technique involves utilizing the reflected light from the iris or fundus (through a dilated pupil) to illuminate the cornea. &#10;&#10;Specular reflection is a mirror-like reflection of light from the cornea that occurs when the angle of incidence of the beam of light equals the angle of reflection. This technique is helpful in viewing abnormalities of the endothelium such as guttata. &#10;&#10;Scleral scatter involves moving the slit beam of light laterally so that it is incident on the limbus, but with the microscope focused centrally. This creates total internal reflection within the cornea and aides in the visualization of stromal lesions, subtle stromal haze, or infiltration of cellular or lipid components. &#10;&#10;Direct illumination is used to detect gross abnormalities of the cornea by directing a slit-beam of light to illuminate the area of interest. Indirect illumination involves viewing an area of the cornea to either side of the direct slit-beam of light. This is helpful in detecting more subtle abnormalities that can be washed out by excessive light levels."

      "answers": [" Guttata   "],
      "explanation": "Oxygen is important for proper corneal clarity and function. Contact lenses can reduce the amount of oxygen that reaches the cornea, thereby affecting its overall physiology. In the presence of hypoxic conditions, the corneal epithelium can develop erosions, edema, microcysts, ulceration, vascularization, and a decrease in cellular mitosis. The stroma is also affected by a lack of oxygen and can develop edema, infiltrates, and vascularization. In the event of hypoxia, the endothelium may form blebs, folds, guttata and/or polymegathism."

      "answers": [" Irregular astigmatism   "],
      "explanation": "Keratoconus causes a thinning of the cornea and is generally located centrally/inferiorly. It is not an inflammatory condition, and most patients tend to be asymptomatic other than reporting decreased visual acuity. Keratoconus is progressive and usually begins during puberty but studies have demonstrated that it tends to stabilize in the third or fourth decade of life. Upon examination, one generally observes myopia, irregular astigmatism, and corneal distortion. Some patients manifest a Fleischer's ring, which is a deposition of iron anterior to Bowman's layer of the cornea. This ring appears at the base of the cone and is green/brown in color. Fleischer's rings are best viewed through a Cobalt blue filter. Some patients may also demonstrate Vogt's striae which appear as fine, gray, parallel, linear wisps with a vertical orientation at the apex of the cornea in the stroma. These are believed to be stress lines caused by stretching of the tissue. If the keratoconus is slightly more advanced, it is possible for the patient to display central corneal scarring caused by ruptures in Bowman's layer. Prominent corneal nerves may also be exhibited by some patients. Roughly 5% of patients will experience a rupture of Descemet's membrane, causing hydrops or corneal edema along with a drop in visual acuity. If the cornea is unable to recover from the rupture in Descemet's, a penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) (corneal transplant) may be warranted. &#10;&#10;It was previously thought that fitting patients in rigid gas-permeable lenses served to slow down the progression of the condition, but present studies do not support this theory. In the early stages, keratoconus can be managed with glasses and soft contact lenses. If there is significant corneal distortion, then gas-permeable lenses or hybrid lenses may offer the best acuity."

      "explanation": "The corneal stroma is comprised mostly of collagen and water. The stroma itself makes up roughly 90% of the thickness of the cornea. This layer is made up of around 250 lamellae organized in a precise orthagonal arrangement to ensure corneal transparency. The space between the collagen bundles that make up the lamellae is maintained by proteoglycans which are composed of protein and carbohydrate. The proteoglycans have a negative charge and thus repel each other. The collagen is upheld and maintained by keratocytes."

      "explanation": "Laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK), laser-assisted epithelial keratomileusis (LASEK), and photorefractive keratotomy (PRK) are all refractive surgery procedures that use an excimer laser to ablate corneal tissue with subsequent correction of refractive error. These techniques differ in the way in which the deeper corneal tissue (stroma) is reached. LASIK involves the creation of a flap of corneal tissue. LASEK involves the removal of the corneal epithelium in a sheet that is then repositioned after ablation is complete. In PRK, the epithelium is completely removed and a bandage contact lens placed over the cornea after ablation to allow the epithelium to heal. The excimer laser used in these refractive procedures alters corneal stromal tissue, thus the need to expose this layer of the cornea. &#10;&#10;Conductive keratoplasty is a procedure in which laser burns are placed in the corneal mid-periphery to induce stromal shrinkage and subsequent steepening of the cornea. Radial keratotomy involves the creation of radial incisions formed by a blade to flatten the corneal curvature."

      "answers": [" Conductive keratoplasty   "],
      "explanation": "In cases where the corneal curvature must be steepened in order to correct for refractive error (hyperopia or presbyopia), conductive keratoplasty (CK) is a viable surgical option. Although this surgical procedure was used more often in earlier years, it is not currently as widely used as laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). In comparison to CK, LASIK and PRK tend to be safe, have long-standing results, and more predictable outcomes. The CK technique involves using a radiofrequency probe to create burns in either one or two concentric rings in the mid-peripheral region of the cornea. These thermal laser burns cause subsequent stromal shrinkage, which results in an increase in the curvature of the cornea. This change in curvature typically decays over time, but the procedure can be repeated. &#10;&#10;Radial keratotomy is also an older surgical procedure in which a diamond blade is used to create several radial corneal incisions (the number and depth of the incisions depends on the refractive error) in order to flatten the corneal curvature in patients with myopic refractive errors. Limbal relaxation incisions are similar in that arcuate incisions are made on opposite sides of the corneal periphery in the meridian of the 'plus' cylinder axis in order to create flattening of the steep corneal curvature (with some smaller steepening of the flat meridian) in an attempt to reduce the amount of corneal astigmatism. &#10;&#10;Photorefractive keratotomy (PRK) and laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) are refractive surgery techniques that use an excimer laser to ablate corneal tissue to a certain depth in either the central cornea (to correct myopia) or peripherally (to correct hyperopia)."

      "options": [" Lattice dystrophy   ", " Epithelial basement membrane dystrophy  ", " Granular dystrophy  ", " Macular dystrophy  "],
      "answers": [" Lattice dystrophy   "],
      "explanation": "Lattice dystrophy is an autosomal dominant dystrophy (except for type III, which is autosomal recessive) with four sub-types categorized according to age of onset, systemic involvement, causative mutation, and appearance. Essentially this condition is due to a deposition of amyloid causing a decrease in visual acuity. The opacifications in this dystrophy appear as thick or thin lines and dots (depending on the sub-type). Although some sources state that granular dystrophy is more frequently encountered, the majority of literature agrees that in fact the most common stromal dystrophy is of the lattice type. &#10;&#10;Granular dystrophy results from a deposition of eosinophilic hyaline in the anterior stroma. Again this condition is autosomal dominant and onsets in the first decade of life. As time passes, the deposits tend to coalesce and cause a decrease in visual acuity. Granular dystrophy presents with a clear limbal zone. The stroma between the opacities remains clear in the early stages of the condition. &#10;&#10;Macular dystrophy occurs secondary to a deposition of glycosaminoglycans in the stroma during the first decade of life. This condition is autosomal recessive and causes poor vision by the time the patient reaches 20-30 years of age due to corneal thinning and enlargement of opacities involving all of the corneal layers. This dystrophy extends to the limbus. The preferred surgical intervention is a corneal transplant. Macular dystrophy is the most visually devastating of the three stromal dystrophies mentioned here. &#10;&#10;Epithelial basement membrane dystrophy is not a stromal dystrophy. &#10;&#10;References: &#10;Cornea Handbook, Trattler W., Majmudar, P., Luchs, J & Swartz, T.

      "question": "A patient returns to your office after having undergone LASIK four days ago concerned with progressive loss of acuity. His refraction has undergone a hyperopic shift with the presence of astigmatism. Biomicroscopy reveals white granular infiltrates located diffusely across the interface. The conjunctiva is white and quiet and the corneal surface does not stain with fluorescein. There is no anterior chamber reaction. Given the above findings what is the MOST appropriate diagnosis?",
      "options": [" Microbial keratitis  ", " Diffuse lamellar keratitis   ", " Dry eye syndrome  ", " Epithelial ingrowth  "],
      "answers": [" Diffuse lamellar keratitis   "],
      "explanation": "Diffuse lamellar keratitis (DLK), sometimes referred to as the Sands of Sahara, typically occurs two to five days post-LASIK. Initially the patient will note a progressive decrease in visual acuity. Biomicroscopy will reveal diffuse inflammatory infiltrates located across the periphery of the surgical interface but do not penetrate into the stroma nor do they extend into the flap. Very early cases will display infiltrates along the edge of the flap. Generally there will be little to no injection of the conjunctiva, the corneal surface will remain intact and there will be no reaction in the anterior chamber. The patient usually does not notice any discomfort. As the condition progresses, the patient will continue to notice a decrease in acuity. The subjective refraction will become hyperopic with astigmatism. The number of granular infiltrates will increase and diffusely cover the flap interface and a central haze will develop. With time, the central haze will become more condensed and may appear wave-like. Stromal folds may develop but some believe that this is actually not related to DLK but some other variant and thusly should not be classified as DLK. Either way, treatment is aggressive and consists of topical steroid drops every hour. If the infiltrates are severely condensed, the flap may have to lifted, the interface debrided and the flap refloated to remove them. If this condition is not detected and treated early, stromal melt along with severe scarring and poor visual acuity could ensue. &#10;&#10;It is important to be able to distinguish between microbial keratitis and DLK, as the treatments differ for each. If you treat microbial keratitis with a steroid, you are only increasing the risk of infection as the steroid will suppress the body's ability to fight infectious organisms. Remember, in general, infections will cause redness and usually will not limit themselves to the surgical interface. Some form of discharge will likely be present, and the patient will generally note some type of discomfort or irritation. &#10;&#10;Dry eye syndrome may present with mild injection of the conjunctiva and superficial punctate keratitis but infiltrates in general will not occur with this condition. The patient may report a foreign body sensation along with burning and stinging of the eyes. &#10;&#10;Epithelial ingrowth tends to develop several days to weeks post-LASIK and initially presents along the flap edge interface. Ingrowth generally progresses at a slower rate than DLK and most likely will not present diffusely throughout the flap-stromal incision sites at such a rapid rate. &#10;&#10;Reference: Agarwal, A., Jacob, S.

      "question": "You suspect allergic conjunctivitis as the cause of your 22 year-old patient's symptoms of red, watery, itchy eyes. If you were to perform a conjunctival scraping, the presence of which of the following types of cells would confirm your diagnosis?",
      "options": [" Monocytes  ", " Eosinophils   ", " Neutrophils  ", " Lymphocytes  ", " Basophils  "],
      "answers": [" Eosinophils   "],
      "explanation": "Allergic conjunctivitis is an ocular inflammatory response that is triggered by IgE-induced mast cell and basophil degranulation in response to an antigen. These cells, once degranulated, release histamines, cytokines, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, interleukins, chemokines and other mediators (early phase), which produce the classical symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. In the later phase of the allergic response, infiltration of inflammatory cells such as eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes also occur, with eosinophils predominating. Therefore, if the conjunctival secretions were to be stained, one would likely observe numerous eosinophils present. Eosinophils are not typically present in the conjunctival scrapings of normal patients, so their presence is consistent with a diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis. &#10;&#10;Patterson, R., Grammer, L.C., Greenberger, P.A.

      "explanation": "Marginal infiltrates are sterile lesions that will culture negative when tested, although Staphylococcal aureus bacteria are frequently found concurrently on the eyelid margins in the area of the infiltrates. Marginal keratitis is thought to be the result of a reaction to excessive staphylococcal exotoxins and cell wall proteins produced by bacteria on the eyelids. This debris causes deposition of antigen-antibody complexes in the peripheral cornea (antigen diffuses from the tear film, antibody from the blood vessels), along with secondary lymphocytic infiltration, leading to the appearance of a whitish, subepithelial lesion that is separated from the limbus by a zone of clear cornea."

      "explanation": "Corneal collagen cross-linking is a surgical procedure in which UVA light and riboflavin are utilized to stiffen the collagen matrix of the corneal stroma. The procedure varies between surgeons, but typically involves either full or partial debridement of the corneal epithelium to allow for maximal absorption of isotonic riboflavin into the stromal tissue. Drops of riboflavin are instilled until the yellow-color of the riboflavin is apparent in the anterior chamber (by use of a lit-lamp and blue light). The thickness of the cornea is then measured, as it must be greater than 400 microns to continue with the UV light exposure. Once this is confirmed, UVA radiation is then applied to the cornea (with riboflavin drops still being instilled) until the desired treatment time has elapsed. The cornea is then irrigated thoroughly, and a bandage contact lens is placed on the eye. &#10;&#10;Surgical Techniques In Ophthalmology: Corneal Surgery. Garg, A., Alio, J.L. 2010.

      "options": [" Normal force perpendicular to the corneal place  ", " Gravitational force  ", " Direct pressure perpendicular to the globe  ", " Lateral shearing force   "],
      "answers": [" Lateral shearing force   "],
      "explanation": "Due to the arrangement and architecture of the collagen fibrils that make up the cornea, it is capable of resisting forces of up to 30 atm when applied in the same direction as the visual axis. However, the cornea is not capable of resisting lateral shearing forces. The way that the cornea is structured, the lamellae can slide past one another. This explains why a probe is easily inserted between lamellae into the stroma. &#10;&#10;Normal force is a support force that is exerted onto an object by another object that is stable. For example, a car resting on a road pushes down on the road but the road exerts an upward force back on the car to support its weight."

      "question": "Your patient has a corneal ulcer and you wish to determine how deep the ulcer has penetrated into the cornea using the slit lamp. Which of the following types of illumination would be the MOST appropriate to achieve the above?",
      "options": [" Optic section   ", " Specular reflection  ", " Conical beam  ", " Diffuse illumination  ", " Sclerotic scatter  "],
      "answers": [" Optic section   "],
      "explanation": "An optic section is achieved by setting the beam width on the biomicroscope to roughly 0.5 mm. The illumination system is then placed at an angle from the oculars that permits one to effectively 'slice' the cornea into its constituent layers, allowing for depth localization. An optic section is also used to determine angle estimation. &#10;&#10;Diffuse illumination is accomplished by increasing the aperture size to greater than 4 mm in width, allowing for gross estimation of structures such as the lids, lashes, and conjunctiva. &#10;&#10;A conical beam is an illumination technique used to assess the anterior chamber for possible cells and flare seen secondary to an inflammatory reaction. A conical beam is achieved by making the aperture width and height of the light housing as small as possible and shifting the focus back and forth between the lens and the cornea to assess the anterior chamber. The illumination system should be set at an angle from the oculars. In order to maximize visibility, it is important to turn off all other sources of light in the examination room, and the examiner should be dark-adapted. &#10;&#10;Specular reflection is used to evaluate the quality of a surface such as the corneal endothelium or tear film. This type of illumination is achieved by placing the light housing in the straight ahead position and moving the oculars so that they create an angle of 45 degrees with the illumination system. The beam width should be about 1 mm. The achieved image will be observable through only one ocular at a time. &#10;&#10;Sclerotic scatter is achieved by placing the illumination system at an angle of roughly 60 degrees from the oculars, positioned to illuminate the temporal limbus with a parallelepiped of roughly 1 mm in width. The examiner then observes the cornea outside of the oculars for signs of corneal abnormalities, such as central corneal clouding."

      ],
      "answers": [" Papillae contain a central fibrovascular core that arborizes upon reaching the conjunctival surface   ", " Papillae are commonly associated with bacterial conjunctivitis   "],
      "explanation": "Conjunctival follicles typically present as discrete, pale yellowish-white, round elevations that are most prominent in the conjunctival fornices. Blood vessels associated with these bumps sweep over the surface of the follicle from the base, as they do not contain a vascular core. Follicles are usually 0.5 to 2.0mm in diameter but vary depending on the severity and duration of the disease. The presence of a follicular response is common in viral and chlamydial conjunctivitis, Parinaud's oculoglandular syndrome, and is also observed in relation to hypersensitivity reactions to topical medications. &#10;&#10;Conjunctival papillae are only found where the conjunctiva is attached to the underlying deeper fibrous layer such as the tarsal conjunctiva and limbal bulbar conjunctiva. Smaller micropapillae form a mosaic pattern that appear as polygonal elevated red dots that are less than 1mm in size. These bumps have a central fibrovascular core that arborizes as the vessel reaches the surface of the papillae. Papillary reactions can occur secondary to allergic and bacterial conjunctivitis, contact lens wear, chronic blepharitis, superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis, and floppy eyelid syndrome."

      "explanation": "A lamellar keratoplasty involves a partial thickness excision and transplantation of the corneal epithelium and stroma only, leaving the deep stroma and corneal endothelium intact. This type of procedure is typically indicated in patients with localized corneal thinning, marginal corneal thinning or infiltration, or opacification of the superficial 1/3 of the corneal stroma. &#10;&#10;A deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty is a transplantation procedure in which all of the opaque corneal tissue is removed almost all the way to the level of Descemet's membrane. It is indicated in patients who have a corneal disease involving 95% of the corneal thickness but who maintain a healthy corneal endothelium with an absence of breaks in Descemet's membrane. &#10;&#10;A penetrating keratoplasty is a surgical procedure in which the full thickness of the cornea is replaced by donor tissue. This procedure is used in cases where the endothelium is compromised, there is dense and deep corneal scarring, severely infected corneal tissue, or degenerative diseases that could potentially recur."

His subjective refraction is -16.00 -0.75 x 180 OD and -15.00-0.25 x 167 OS which he reports has been stable for four years. Which type of surgery would be the BEST option for him?",
      "options": [" Photo-refractive keratectomy (PRK)  ", " Implantable collamer lens (ICL)   ", " Refractive lens exchange (RLE)  ", " Conductive keratoplasty (CK)  ", " Laser assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK)  "],
      "answers": [" Implantable collamer lens (ICL)   "],
      "explanation": "Due to the nature of this patient's high prescription, the only viable options of the choices presented would be either ICL or RLE. However, if he were to undergo a refractive lens exchange in which the clear crystalline lens is removed and replaced with a corrective posterior chamber intraocular lens implant, ultimately he would end up presbyopic and would require some form of near correction. RLE procedures are best reserved for presbyopes who are dependent upon reading glasses already. Therefore, the best option for our patient would be implantable collamer lenses. This procedure offers several advantages in that it is not permanent and can be reversed without thinning of the corneal tissue. Essentially, in this technique a corrective lens is implanted either in front of or behind the iris without removal of the natural crystalline lens. One must exercise caution: if the surgeon is not careful and either the corneal endothelium or the natural lens is touched during the procedure, there is a risk of endothelial cell loss or cataract formation. For lenses placed in the anterior chamber, a peripheral laser iridotomy is performed to prevent the development of pupillary block glaucoma. &#10;&#10;Conductive keratoplasty is a type of refractive surgery that is performed on low hyperopes (+0.75 to +3.00 D with less than 0.75 D of astigmatism). A thin probe is inserted into the peripheral cornea at specified intervals which delivers radiofrequency energy and causes a shrinking of the surrounding collagen. The circular ring of altered collagen results in a steepening of the central cornea and thus a decrease in hyperopia. The results of CK are temporary and generally do not last more than a few years. &#10;&#10;Photo-refractive keratectomy (PRK) requires the use of an excimer laser to ablate the corneal epithelium and then refine the underlying tissue. PRK has been used for thin corneas and can eliminate up to roughly 7.00 D of myopia. This procedure may be quite painful and entails a long recovery time while the epithelium regenerates. PRK also requires the use of a bandage contact lens during the recovery period. &#10;&#10;LASIK also utilizes a laser to alter the corneal thickness. Past LASIK procedures utilized a microkeratome to cut a flap and expose the underlying tissue for sculpting. It is now more common for the flap to be created by a laser, which allows for better precision and reproducibility of incision depth. Reportedly, LASIK can be used to correct up to 12.00 D of myopia, 6.00 D of astigmatism, and 6.00 D of hyperopia. LASIK is quite popular due to its good results, increased reliability, quick recovery time and decreased level of discomfort when compared to surface ablation refractive surgeries.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Refractive Surgery"

      "answers": [" Post LASIK for myopia   ", " Post radial keratotomy   ", " Post orthokeratology   "],
      "explanation": "A normal cornea has a prolate shape in which the corneal curvature is steeper in the center and flattens towards the periphery. An oblate shaped cornea is one in which the corneal curvature is flattened in the center and then steepens in the periphery. &#10;&#10;There are several circumstances that can alter a normal prolate corneal curvature resulting in a more oblate shaped cornea. These include LASIK surgery for correction of myopia, due to the fact that the excimer laser will flatten the central corneal curvature in order to correct for the myopic refractive error. Radial keratotomy will also result in an oblate corneal shape as the radial cuts also cause flattening of the central corneal curvature. Orthokeratology contact lenses create a more oblate corneal shape due to the reverse geometry shape of the contacts that causes central corneal flattening. &#10;&#10;Keratoconus and LASIK for hyperopia actually have the opposite effect and cause further steepening of the central corneal curvature."

      "options": [" Presbyopia  ", " Post sub-capsular opacification  ", " Flap dislocation  ", " Epithelial ingrowth   "],
      "answers": [" Epithelial ingrowth   "],
      "explanation": "The most common complication associated with an enhancement after previously undergoing LASIK is epithelial ingrowth. Although this condition can occur after the first LASIK procedure due to poor flap adhesion or from stray epithelial cells remaining under the flap, it is far more common with enhancements. Some surgeons are attempting to decrease the incidence of ingrowth occurrence with enhancements by re-cutting a new flap or via refractive keratotomy (RK). In general, ingrowth does not cause a problem if it is isolated to a small area and if there is little elevation or change with time. If the ingrowth is significant and vision is compromised, treatment requires that the flap be lifted and the offending cells removed. &#10;&#10;Posterior capsular opacification only occurs after cataract surgery when residual lenticular epithelial cells proliferate, causing opacification of the posterior aspect of the space between the posterior lens implant and the posterior capsule. If vision is compromised, treatment requires that the cells be removed via a YAG laser."

      ],
      "answers": [" Ruptures in Descemet's membrane allow for an influx of aqueous into the corneal stroma   "],
      "explanation": "Acute corneal hydrops is a condition caused by ruptures in Descemet's membrane that allow for a sudden relative influx of aqueous into the corneal stroma. This subsequently causes a reduction in visual acuity due to loss of corneal clarity, with associated ocular discomfort, redness, foreign body sensation, and watering of the eyes. Slit-lamp examination in these cases will reveal significant central or inferior corneal edema with associated hyperemia of the conjunctiva. Acute hydrops typically affects one eye at a time. The contralateral eye usually exhibits signs of keratoconus but without the presence of hydrops. This condition is self-limiting and usually takes up to 8 to 10 weeks for the cornea to heal and edema to resolve. During this time, the corneal endothelial cells will migrate across the area of rupture in Descemet's membrane to re-establish stromal deturgescence. Sodium chloride drops and ointment may be used as a therapeutic treatment, as well as a broad-spectrum antibiotic to protect the compromised cornea from infection. Corneal scar formation after resolution of hydrops is common; therefore, topical steroids are occasionally considered in an effort to minimize subsequent scarring from occurring."

      "answers": [" Trachoma   "],
      "explanation": "Trachoma is more common in lesser-developed countries and can cause blindness if not treated appropriately. Trachoma presents in several stages, initially starting with mucopurulent discharge, lymphadenopathy, red eye, small superior tarsal follicles, and mild superior pannus. This infection eventually progresses to horrible scarring of the eyelid and cornea, causing extremely poor visual acuity. Arlt's lines denote the characteristic linear scarring that occurs on the palpebral conjunctival surface. This scarring of the eyelids can cause entropion and trichiasis which abrade the cornea leading to scarring and/or ulceration. Herbert's pits are conjunctival depressions or excavations caused by scarring of limbal follicles that occurs along the limbocorneal junction. Treatment includes oral doxycycline, tetracycline, azithromycin, or erythromycin along with topical tetracycline or erythromycin ointment. &#10;&#10;A recurrent corneal erosion generally occurs in response to a corneal abrasion incurred by something organic (like a finger-nail or a tree branch). The initial abrasion heals but a short time afterwards the patient will experience another episode without any new incidence of trauma. The second occurrence tends to transpire first thing in the morning; the eyelids stick to the unstable flap of tissue and rip it off like a band-aid when the eyes open. The best way to treat a recurrent corneal erosion is through the use of a topical antibiotic (unpreserved is best) to ensure sterility (as the cornea is exposed) as well as a bandage contact lens to speed up the healing process. Some argue that a bandage contact lens can pose more problems than it solves as the lens must be worn continually for a minimum of 10-12 weeks (the lens should be changed intermittently). Hyperosmotic drops or artificial tears should be prescribed for roughly 10-12 weeks to ensure healing and to allow for proper formation of hemidesmosomes to alleviate future episodes. Other treatments include stromal micropuncture or debridement. &#10;&#10;VKC is a condition of the young and presents with an increased frequency in males. This type of allergy typically develops before age 14 and lasts for 4-10 years before the child outgrows it; it occurs predominantly in the spring and summer. The condition progressively improves, with the first episode being the most severe. Usually VKC is seen in patients who are prone to atopy and therefore they suffer from eczema, asthma or hay fever. Patients typically suffer from itchy eyes and photophobia. The condition basically presents as a very severe type of allergic conjunctivitis. Signs include cobblestone papillae of the upper lid, lid swelling, and ropy discharge that is worse in the morning. Corneal defects (usually superiorly) known as keratitis of Togby may also be present. Occasionally, patients will develop a shield ulcer and Tranta's dots, which are calcified eosinophils seen circumlimbally (they appear as chalky concretions) and may lead to the feeling of an associated foreign body sensation. Treatment includes mast cell stabilizers that should be started several weeks prior to re-occurring episodes, pulse steroid therapy, cool compresses, and sunglasses to help alleviate ensuing photophobia. &#10;&#10;Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is a very common and contagious infection of viral etiology. EKC is caused by the adenovirus; there are many different strains, but the two most common to cause ocular infections are serotypes 8 and 19. EKC is said to follow the 'rule of 8s' because type 8 is the type most frequently isolated; on the 8th day, the patient will present will diffuse superficial punctate keratitis (SPK), followed 8 days later (16 days from inoculation) by the formation of sub-epithelial infiltrates (SEIs). Once SEIs are present, the patient is no longer considered contagious. Signs of EKC include follicular conjunctivitis, positive lymph adenopathy, and mild lid edema. Small sub-conjunctival hemorrhages, pseudo-membranes, and iritis may also be present. Treatment for this condition is generally palliative and consists of ocular lubrication, topical vasoconstrictors, cool or warm compresses, topical NSAIDs, and sunglasses. Some clinicians use a Betadine® (5%) ophthalmic solution off-label treatment in office, which seems to be rather effective. The use of steroids is still controversial because EKC and the Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can initially present similarly, and steroid use on HSV can lead to horrendous corneal damage. Topical steroids are very effective if the patient suffers from SEIs that are visually debilitating, but be sure to taper the steroid use."

      "answers": [" Avellino dystrophy (Granular dystrophy type 2)   "],
      "explanation": "Patients with Avellino dystrophy will show histological changes consistent with the abnormal deposition of both amyloid and hyaline in the stroma. &#10;&#10;Granular dystrophy type 1 shows abnormal amorphous hyaline deposits only in the corneal stroma. &#10;&#10;Macular dystrophy shows abnormal aggregations of glycosaminoglycans as well as unusually close packing of collagen fibrils in the corneal lamellae. &#10;&#10;Epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (map-dot-fingerprint dystrophy) and Meesmann dystrophy are both epithelial dystrophies in which histological studies show irregular thickening of the basement membrane. Map-dot-fingerprint dystrophy also exhibits an abnormal deposition of fibrillary protein and a relative absence of hemidesmosomes of the basal epithelial cells. Meesmann dystrophy will show intraepithelial cysts in addition to the basement membrane changes. &#10;&#10;Reis-Buckler dystrophy is a dystrophy of Bowman's membrane in which Bowman's layer and the epithelial basement membrane of the cornea are replaced with fibrous tissue."

      "options": [" Reis-Bucklers   ", " Arcus senilis  ", " Limbal girdle of Vogt  ", " Crocodile Shagreen  "],
      "answers": [" Reis-Bucklers   "],
      "explanation": "Reis-Bucklers corneal dystrophy is limited to Bowman's layer and has an onset within the first decade of life due to its autosomal dominance inheritance pattern. This condition reveals itself as sub-epithelial opacities in a ring-like, honeycomb, or fishnet pattern in the central to mid-peripheral cornea. The cornea can become hazy and the overlying epithelium may thicken, but the peripheral cornea is spared. People with this condition will likely suffer from recurrent corneal erosions and decreased vision. Management can include bandage contact lenses, phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), superficial keratectomy, or a corneal transplant. &#10;&#10;Corneal arcus is commonly seen in the elderly as a bilateral yellow/white ring that encircles the cornea while maintaining a clear zone between itself and the limbus. The ring occurs due to lipid leakage from limbal blood vessels. Treatment is not generally required as vision is not affected. However, if the patient is under 50 years of age, consider systemic hyperlipidemia and refer for blood work. If the patient is under 40 years of age and presents with arcus, refer for a serum cholesterol measurement. Lastly, if the arcus is unilateral, check for carotid occlusion on the side that DOES NOT display corneal arcus. &#10;&#10;A limbal girdle of Vogt is located in the interpalpebral zone at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions of the cornea and presents in two variations. The less common form leaves a clear zone between itself and the limbus and appears as a white/yellow band that remains in the peripheral cornea and is considered to be an early form of band keratopathy. The second form is contiguous with the conjunctiva and may be mistaken for a pinguecula because there is no clear zone between itself and the limbus. The white-yellow band occurs as a result of collagen breakdown in Bowman's layer; no treatment is necessary. &#10;&#10;Crocodile shagreen generally appears in the peripheral cornea and takes on the form of polygonal white/gray opacities that resemble a mosaic or cracked ice. Patients are usually elderly and do not require treatment."

      "answers": [" Keratoconus   "],
      "explanation": "Diabetes may lead to changes of the extracellular matrix of the cornea, potentially rendering it thicker centrally and more pliable, both of which act as protective factors against keratoconus (as well as glaucoma). Research has also confirmed a decreased likelihood of keratoconus in patients who smoke, possibly due to increased formation of collagen cross-linking. &#10;&#10;A strong correlation between smoking and the development of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) has been established. It has been postulated that the risk of ARMD incidence increases with smoking due to a depletion of both antioxidants (such as beta-carotene) as well as diminished macular pigment levels. &#10;&#10;Diabetes (particularly when uncontrolled) is linked with the development of retinal neovascularization. &#10;&#10;It has been postulated that retinitis pigmentosa may serve to decrease the likelihood of retinopathy associated with uncontrolled diabetes; however, a decreased risk of RP development due to a concurrent diagnosis of diabetes has yet to be established. &#10;&#10;References: &#10;&#10;Clinical Manual of Contact Lenses, 4th edition.

      "options": [" Rose bengal   ", " Sodium fluorescein  ", " Lissamine green   ", " Methylene blue  "],
      "answers": [" Rose bengal   ", " Lissamine green   "],
      "explanation": "Rose Bengal is an iodine derivative of fluorescein that preferentially stains the nuclei of devitalized cells, dead cells, and mucin. It is typically applied via a moistened filter paper strip or in drop form to the conjunctiva and is very helpful in evaluating keratoconjunctivitis sicca, herpes simplex lesions, corneal abrasions, ulcerations, foreign bodies, and conjunctival tissue changes. Rose Bengal has also been shown to have some antiviral properties. &#10;&#10;Lissamine green stains degenerated cells, dead cells, and mucous in a very similar manner to that of Rose Bengal; however, lissamine green is preferentially used due to marked ocular irritation and discomfort that tends to occur more frequently with the use of Rose Bengal. &#10;&#10;Methylene blue has properties similar to Rose Bengal but also has the ability to stain corneal nerves. &#10;&#10;Sodium fluorescein is the most widely utilized dye for use in eye care due to its low toxicity and excellent fluorescent properties. It is most commonly used in the assessment of corneal and conjunctival lesions, foreign bodies, in the fitting and management of contact lenses, and in the measurement of intraocular pressure. &#10;&#10;Textbook of Ophthalmology: Basic Sciences, Optics and Refraction, Neuro-ophthalmology, Strabismus.

      "explanation": "Perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC) presents with acute, transient attacks of ocular itching, redness, and watering that is usually accompanied by nasal discharge and sneezing. Edema of the eyelids is also commonly associated, as well as chemosis and a mild papillary reaction of the conjunctiva. &#10;&#10;Perennial allergic conjunctivitis is less common and usually presents with milder symptoms as compared to seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC). Patients suffering from PAC typically report that symptoms occur year-round but tend to exacerbate in the autumn months (when animal dander, dust mites, and fungal allergens are greatest). Patients with SAC (hay fever) commonly report that symptoms occur in the spring and summer months, with tree and grass pollens being the most frequent offending agent."

      ],
      "answers": [" A prominent, anteriorly displaced Schwalbe's line   "],
      "explanation": "Posterior embryotoxon presents as a thin, greyish-white, arcuate shaped ridge that runs adjacent to and parallels the limbus at the inner surface of the cornea. It represents a prominent, slightly anteriorly displaced Schwalbe's line. Posterior embryotoxon is a variant of normal, is not associated with significant pathology, and does not require treatment. &#10;&#10;Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly occurs in association with posterior embryotoxon. Strands of iris tissue from the iris base insert at the anteriorly displaced Schwalbe's line. &#10;&#10;Abnormal adherence of the iris to the corneal endothelium is known as anterior synechia, while abnormal adherences to the anterior surface of the lens are referred to as posterior synechiae. &#10;&#10;Remnants of the fetal iris membrane that present as thin strands crossing the pupil are considered persistent pupillary membranes."

Epithelial ingrowth can advance rapidly or remain the same for months and years, so it is important to accurately draw what is seen at each visit. Epithelial ingrowth that is advancing should be referred to the operating surgeon for removal. Any debris or cells found in the interface affecting vision or flap integrity should be removed in the laser suite under an operating microscope and patients should not be enhanced for at least 3 months after an initial procedure."

Clinical signs that are commonly observed in SLK are superior bulbar conjunctival thickening and radial injection, especially near the limbus. When light downward pressure is placed on the upper eyelids, a fold of conjunctival tissue will commonly cross the upper limbus. Staining is usually observed on the superior cornea, limbal region, and bulbar conjunctiva. Another important clinical feature is the presence of fine papillae on the superior tarsal conjunctiva that results in a velvety appearance. Papillae are also occasionally observed at the limbus, as well as superior filamentary keratitis, in more severe cases of SLK."

      "answers": [" The aqueous humor   "],
      "explanation": "The cornea requires oxygen and glucose to function properly. The corneal epithelium is not permeable to glucose; however, some glucose is supplied to the peripheral cornea via diffusion from limbal blood vessels. The majority of glucose used by the cornea originates from the aqueous humor which diffuses across the endothelium."

      "answers": [" The stroma   "],
      "explanation": "The corneal epithelium is comprised of 3 major layers. The outermost layer is composed of superficial cells (2-3 layers) followed by wing cells (2-3 layers) and, lastly, basal cells (1 layer). Damage to the epithelium will heal without keloid formation. The epithelial basement membrane is made up of collagen types IV, VII and XII. &#10;&#10;The stroma makes up the bulk of the cornea and is comprised of keratocytes, nerves, type I collagen fibers and mucopolysaccharides. If injured, the stroma will heal but a scar will remain at the site of trauma. &#10;&#10;The tear film lies anterior to the cornea and is not composed of tissue and as such cannot scar, nor is it considered a part of the cornea."

      "explanation": "A retinal detachment is not an absolute contraindication for laser vision correction. It is advisable to have patients with any type of retinal pathology undergo evaluation by a retinal specialist and obtain approval from that physician prior to surgery. There are no studies that indicate that patients with either pavingstone degeneration or lattice degeneration are at any greater risk of retinal detachment after laser vision correction. Some surgeons prefer PRK for patients with retinal degeneration."

      "answers": [" They should have photorefractive keratectomy (PRK)   "],
      "explanation": "Recurrent corneal erosions occur in an area where the epithelium is not secured to the anterior stroma, usually from either an abrasion or epithelial basement membrane dystrophy. The mechanical action of creating a corneal flap either with a microkeratome or a femtosecond laser can cause the epithelium to erode in the 'weakly adherent' area. Therefore, it is not advisable to use either of those methods to treat the eye. Phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) has been shown to be an effective treatment of recurrent erosions, therefore simultaneously adding refractive correction (Photorefractive keratectomy) is also an effective treatment with the added benefit of correcting the patient's refractive error."

A patient with keratoconus will display a thinned area of epithelium over the apex of the cone surrounded circumferentially by an area of thicker epithelium. &#10;&#10;Patients with keratoconus also display stromal thinning at the apex of the cone as well as increased epithelial cell shape variation.

      "answers": [" Controlled type II diabetes   "],
      "explanation": "LASIK is a procedure that results in thinning of the cornea; therefore, a person who has thin corneas to begin with or any corneal conditions resulting in irregular astigmatism or ectasia is not a good candidate. The presence of an active ocular disease such as conjunctivitis, microbial keratitis, or corneal erosions would also contraindicate a patient, as these diseases can lead to very serious post-LASIK infections and unpredictable surgical outcomes. A keloid former is a patient who is prone to producing a lot of scar tissue in the event of trauma or tissue manipulation. If a lot of scar tissue is present after surgery, this can increase the perception of light scatter and haloes, thereby decreasing acuity levels. Also, extreme scarring may also alter the shape of the cornea and offset the desired final outcome causing over- or under-correction or undesired astigmatism. &#10;&#10;Controlled type II diabetes is not a contraindication as long as there is no diabetic retinopathy present."

      "question": "A 33-year old female is seen at your office complaining of a sudden onset of red, irritated eyes that itch and burn along with a mild, clear, watery discharge. Biomicroscopy reveals palpebral conjunctival follicles inferiorly along with mild eyelid edema and bilateral tender pre-auricular nodes. The cornea does not reveal any epithelial defects. You correctly diagnose the patient with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC). Which of the following is the BEST treatment option?",
      "options": [
        " Topical proparacaine 1 drop BID  ",
        " Non-preserved artificial tears every two hours and a topical vasoconstrictor QID  ",

        " Topical trifluridine 1 drop every two hours  "
      ],
      "answers": [" Non-preserved artificial tears every two hours and a topical vasoconstrictor QID  "],
      "explanation": "Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is a very common and contagious infection of viral etiology. EKC is caused by the adenovirus, of which there are many different strains, but the most common to cause ocular infections are serotypes 8 and 19. EKC is said to follow the 'rule of 8s' because type 8 is the type most frequently isolated; on the 8th day the patient will present will diffuse superficial punctate keratitis (SPK), followed 8 days later (16 days from inoculation) by the formation of sub-epithelial infiltrates (SEIs). Once SEIs are present, the patient is no longer considered contagious. Signs of EKC include follicular conjunctivitis, positive lymph adenopathy, and mild lid edema. Small sub-conjunctival hemorrhages, pseudo-membranes, and iritis may also be present. Treatment for this condition is generally palliative and consists of ocular lubrication, topical vasoconstrictors, cool or warm compresses, topical NSAIDs, and sunglasses. Some clinicians use a Betadine (5%) ophthalmic solution off-label treatment in office, which seems to work rather well. The use of steroids is still controversial because EKC and the Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can initially present similarly, and steroid use on HSV can lead to horrendous corneal damage. Topical steroids are very effective if the patient suffers from SEIs that are visually debilitating but be sure to taper the steroid use. The use of topical antivirals is not effective in eradicating the virus and will only serve to damage the cornea. Topical antibacterials are only prescribed when there exists the potential of developing a secondary bacterial conjunctivitis."

      "question": "Which of the following ocular signs is virtually pathognomonic for trachoma caused by chlamydia?",
      "options": [" Tranta's dots  ", " Superior tarsal follicles   ", " Inferior tarsal papillae  ", " Lymphadenopathy  "],
      "answers": [" Superior tarsal follicles   "],
      "explanation": "Chlamydia causes two forms of conjunctivitis, trachoma and inclusion. Trachoma is more common in lesser-developed countries and can cause blindness if not treated appropriately. Trachoma presents in several stages, initially starting with mucopurulent discharge, lymphadenopathy, red eye, small superior tarsal follicles, and mild superior pannus. As the condition evolves, the formation of limbal follicles occurs and will eventually scar causing Hebert's pits, which are characteristic of this infection. This condition, if left untreated, ultimately progresses to horrible scarring of the eyelid (Arlt's line) and cornea, causing extremely poor visual acuity. Diagnosis is made with the observation of two or more of the following: follicles on the upper tarsus, pannus (particularly superiorly), limbal follicles or Herbert's pits and typical conjunctival scarring of the upper lid. Treatment includes oral doxycycline, tetracycline, or erythromycin along with topical tetracycline or erythromycin ointment. Azithromycin is also a good choice because it is given as 1000 mg PO which delivers exceptional compliance; however, this is not to be prescribed to those with liver disease or to young adults under the age of 16. &#10;&#10;Inclusion conjunctivitis is linked to venereal disease and can present either unilaterally or bilaterally (which is more common) as follicles on the upper and lower tarsal plates (lower follicles will be larger and more prominent), lymphadenopathy, possible mucopurulent discharge, lid edema, micropannus, superior corneal sub-epithelial infiltrates, superficial punctate keratitis, and scarring of the upper eyelid (sometimes called Arlt's line or 'basketweave' because of its appearance). This type of conjunctivitis is less severe than trachoma. Treatment is similar to that of trachoma. &#10;&#10;Follicles are related to cellular immunity which serves to protect against viruses. Many types of viral infections can cause inferior palpebral follicles, such as EKC, Herpes simplex and molluscum contagiosum. Superior tarsal follicles are highly suggestive of a chlamydial infection. A superior papillary response is generally associated with an allergic response. Inferior tarsal papillae are frequently seen in bacterial infections and allergic responses as papillae act as the release sites for both eosinophils (associated with allergies) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes which destroy bacteria. &#10;&#10;References: &#10;Clinical Ophthalmology, A Systematic Approach 5th edition.

      "explanation": "Reflex ocular tearing occurs in response to corneal or conjunctival sensory stimulation, break-up of the tear film, and ocular inflammation. These events all lead to excessive secretion of tears through reflex tearing that is mediated by the trigeminal nerve, specifically the ophthalmic branch. In response to an ocular injury, secretion of tears can increase up to 500%."

This type of reaction is seen in allergic disease. Type II reactions are antibody-dependent cytotoxic reactions that are mediated by IgM/IgG and complement. Type III reactions are due to immune complex formation. Immune complex diseases include systemic lupus erythematosus, arthus reactions and serum sickness. Type IV hypersensitivity is delayed-type hypersensitivity and is the result of T-lymphocyte response. Typically, symptoms will occur 2 days after exposure. Prime examples include the PPD test for TB, contact dermatitis, and chronic organ transplant rejection."

      "question": "A 23-year old male walks into your clinic complaining of an eye infection. He states that his eyes have been oozing copious amounts of discharge. Gross examination reveals extremely swollen eyelids and tender and palpable pre-auricular nodes. Given only these findings, what is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [" Vernal conjunctivitis  ", " Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis  ", " Hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae   ", " Contact dermatitis  "],
      "answers": [" Hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae   "],
      "explanation": "There are two main organisms that will cause a hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis. Both are variants of Neisseria. N. gonorrhoeae can be seen in neonates and is contracted from the infected mother when passing through the birth canal. This strain is also seen in adolescents and is usually contracted from an infected adult (this can be a sign of child abuse). Adults acquire hyperacute conjunctivitis via autoinoculation by genitalia that are infected. You are very unlikely to see N. meningitidis because these individuals tend to be hospitalized. This condition is very serious, as the Neisseria species can invade an intact cornea. Also, contraction of this infection must be reported to the CDC. Three tell-tale signs of hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis are a ballooning of the lids, copious amounts of discharge, and swollen pre-auricular nodes. These patients should only be touched with gloves and avoid ALL contact with your own eyes (consider wearing goggles). Treatment requires both oral and topical antibiotic use. These patients require a culture and sensitivity of the bacteria, and remember that time is of the essence with this condition. &#10;&#10;Contact dermatitis presents more as scaly, rough skin that may be swollen but there should not be discharge or swollen pre-auricular nodes. This is a type IV allergic reaction that occurs as a result of contact and re-exposure to some type of allergen. Common allergens of the eyelids include cosmetics, nickel, and topical medications such as neomycin. &#10;&#10;Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) will likely reveal tender pre-auricular nodes as the condition is viral in origin. However, it is rare that you will see copious amounts of discharge with this infection. EKC typically causes watery discharge and can result in swelling of the eyelids. &#10;&#10;Although the above patient possesses the appropriate demographics for vernal conjunctivitis, the signs do not correlate. Vernal conjunctivitis generally presents in young males with a history of atopy. The eyelids may be swollen and emit a thick, ropy discharge but the pre-auricular nodes will not be affected."

      "options": [" Wing cells  ", " Superficial cells  ", " Basal cells   ", " Stromal cells  "],
      "answers": [" Basal cells   "],
      "explanation": "The corneal epithelium can be further subdivided into three zones. The most posterior zone is comprised of a single layer of basal cells which adhere to the epithelial basement membrane. These cells give rise to all of the other zones. Moving exteriorly, the basal cells move more anteriorly and flatten out to become wing cells. This zone is two to three layers thick. The most anterior zone is one to two layers thick and is made up of superficial cells. These cells are flat, plate-like cells . Superficial cells are constantly sloughed off."

His corneas are clear and there are no apparent ocular or systemic contraindications to surgery. Is this patient a good candidate for LASIK?",

      "answers": [" No, neither eye should undergo LASIK   "],
      "explanation": "Unfortunately, this patient is not a good candidate as his high prescription falls outside the specified parameters for LASIK. Reportedly, LASIK can be used to correct up to 12.00 D of myopia, 6.00 D of astigmatism, and 6.00 D of hyperopia. The right eye of our patient has 14.00 D of myopia in the vertical meridian (when in doubt, always place the prescription on an optical cross). His left eye possesses a high amount of astigmatism which also falls outside the range of current approval for LASIK.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Refractive Surgery"

      "question": "Your patient has keratoconus and is pregnant. She would like to know if this condition is hereditary. What is the MOST appropriate response to this question?",
      "options": [
        " Yes, keratoconus is hereditary 100% of the time  ",

      ],
      "answers": [" Yes, there is a hereditary component to keratoconus but it presents with incomplete penetrance   "],
      "explanation": "Although there still remains a lot of debate regarding the genetic link to keratoconus, according to the collaborative longitudinal evaluation in keratoconus study (CLEK) it is believed that the condition is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance. Therefore, there is a slightly higher chance of her child manifesting keratoconus; however, the odds are still quite small. Most patients with diagnosed cases of keratoconus do not profess a family history of the condition. Keratoconus does appear to be linked to eye rubbing, although whether this is a cause or simply a symptom is unclear at this point. There also appears to be a very high correlation between keratoconus and atopy. People who suffer from eczema, allergies, and hay fever tend to display a higher incidence of keratoconus compared to the rest of the general population. Again, this subset of people has a high correlation of eye rubbing associated with ocular irritation, which may contribute to the formation of keratoconus."

Gap junctions between the cells allow for transfer of electrolytes and smaller molecules. The corneal epithelium utilizes tight junctions and desmosomes between cells to create a tight boundary that serves as a strong mechanical barrier.

Hemidesmosomes attach corneal epithelial cells to their basal membrane. Desmosomes attach basal epithelial cells to one another. &#10;&#10;Zonula occludens are tight junctions that act to create a barrier to the movement of water and solutes between epithelial layers in tissues of the body. This is the type of junction that is present between the superficial squamous cells of the corneal epithelium. &#10;&#10;Gap junctions are communicating junctions that allow for direct communication between adjacent cellular cytoplasm by means of diffusion and without contact of the extracellular components."

      "answers": [" +2.00 -1.75 x 090  "],
      "explanation": "When determining the initial toric contact lens prescription to try on a patient, it is first important to know the contact lens parameters that are available for the specific brand of lenses that you would like to use. Most soft toric contact lenses all have very similar parameters; 0.25D steps in the spherical component (0.50 steps with higher Rxs), cylinder component is in 0.50 steps (starting with 0.75, up to 2.25 or 2.75 depending on brand), and cylinder axis is typically in 10-degree steps. &#10;For the above patient, the cylinder component is -2.00D, but this is not available in Air Optix toric lenses. The next closest cylinder prescriptions available would be -1.75D or -2.25D, and the rule is to typically use the lower cylinder value. Therefore, for this patient, we would use -1.75D cyl. When it comes to axis determination, this patient is between 080 and 090 but is closer to 090 degrees, so we would begin with a 090-degree axis lens. It is also appropriate to keep the same sphere power of +2.00D, as we are only adjusting the cylinder power by 0.25, and this is not enough to need to adjust the sphere power as well."

      "explanation": "To determine the proper power, you must calculate the power at the cornea rather than the spectacle plane by utilizing the vertex power formula. Vertexing is important when the power in any meridian exceeds +/- 4.00 D. In order to properly vertex, one must use the following formula: Fc= Fs/1-dFs where Fc= the dioptric power at the corneal plane, Fs= the dioptric power at the spectacle plane, and d= the vertex distance in meters. In general, the vertex distance of the phoropter from the corneal plane is 13 mm unless otherwise specified. Solving for Fc, Fc=+5.50/1- (0.013)(+5.50), Fc = +5.50/1 -(0.0715), Fc= +5.50/0.9285, Fc=+5.93; rounding to the nearest 0.25, Fc is +6.00."

      "question": "Your patient wishes to be fit with a soft contact lens. Subjective refraction reveals OD: -1.50 -1.25 x 090. You place a -1.50 -1.25 x 100 diagnostic contact lens on her right eye. After 20 minutes the lens has settled and you notice that it is rotated 10 degrees to your right and is stable. What final contact lens should be ordered?",
      "options": [" -1.50 -1.25 x 090  ", " -1.50 -1.25 x 110  ", " -1.50 -1.25 x 080   ", " -1.50 -1.25 x 100  ", " -1.50 -1.25 x 070  "],
      "answers": [" -1.50 -1.25 x 080   "],
      "explanation": "Remember the rule of LARS (Left Add Right Subtract). When a toric lens is rotated to the Right you need to Subtract the degree of rotation from the SUBJECTIVE refraction axis, NOT the diagnostic contact lens axis!! When the lens is rotated to the Left you need to Add the degree of rotation to the SUBJECTIVE refraction axis. A very important thing to note is that lens rotation is measured from the DOCTOR'S right or left NOT the patient's. For the above problem the lens is rotated right by 10 degrees therefore the new contact lens will have a calculated axis of 090-010=080 or 80 degrees."

      "question": "An 8.4 mm base curve / -2.50 D power / 14.0 mm overall diameter disposable soft poly-HEMA contact lens results in a plano D over-refraction. If you apply an 8.8 mm base curve / -2.50 D power / 14.0 mm overall diameter disposable soft contact lens to the same eye, what over-refraction would you anticipate?",

      "answers": [" Plano D   "],
      "explanation": "Because a low modulus soft contact lens tends to drape a cornea, there is a resulting plano power tear lens. Therefore, assuming that a different base curve soft lens drapes the cornea, there would be no change to the over-refraction. However, due to the fact that the base curve has been altered, one would expect the movement of the contact lens to either increase or decrease, depending on the curvature of the cornea."

      "question": "You are fitting a toric soft contact lens to your patient's right eye. The patient's manifest refraction is -3.50 -2.00 X 175. You apply a -3.50 -1.75 X 180 diagnostic toric soft contact lens. It fits well, but the horizontal lens markings consistently locate halfway between the 2 and 3 o'clock and 8 and 9 o'clock positions.

      "answers": [" 160 degrees   "],
      "explanation": "Applying LARS (Left Add, Right Subtract) to compensate for lens rotation, since the lens is rotated to the Right, you would Subtract the amount of left rotation to the MANIFEST refraction axis. Every hour on the clock dial would translate to 30 degrees rotation. In the above example, the lens is rotated to the doctor's right by 15 degrees (between the 2 and 3 o'clock, and 8 and 9 o'clock hours). Subtract the amount of rotation (15 degrees) to the cylinder axis of the manifest refraction (175 degrees). This results in a cylinder axis order of 160 degrees."

      "answers": [" 4.50 D   "],
      "explanation": "Assuming the 1-2-3 rule is correct, a base curve toric GP lens with a spherical front surface when analyzed will exhibit a difference in lensometry readings that are 3/2 the amount of the base curve difference measured in diopters. In the above case, the difference in the two measured base curve meridians is 3 diopters; therefore, if there is no toricity on the front surface (that is, this is not a bitoric GP); optically, the difference in the two raw powers measured by lensometry will be 4.50 diopters. For example, the powers could be measured to be 1.00 D in one meridian and -5.50 D in the meridian 90 degrees away, or +2.00 D and -2.50 D. Keep in mind that the 1-2-3 rule is based on the index of refraction (n) of the lens material. Most of today's GP lenses have 'n' values that are in the 1.40 to 1.48 range. This range of 'n' will result in less difference in the measured lensometry powers. For our example of a 3.00 D base curve toric GP lens, the difference in lensometry powers might be 4.00 D for a GP lens fabricated in a material with a lower 'n'."

      "question": "Your 32-year old female patient wishes to be fit with a soft contact lens. Subjective refraction of the right eye is -2.25-1.25 x 090. You place a soft toric diagnostic contact lens of -2.00-0.75 x 090 on her right eye. The over-refraction reveals -0.50-0.50 x 090. What contact lens should be ordered given the above findings?",

      "answers": [" -2.50 -1.25 x 090   "],
      "explanation": "The over-refraction reveals that the sphere portion of the contact lens needs to be increased by -0.50 D, as does the astigmatism, because the patient accepted cylinder power as well. This is straightforward math because the meridians of the astigmatism are the same. If the patient accepts cylinder power 90 degrees away from the axis of delivery, this is actually considered a rejection of astigmatism correction because the patient accepted astigmatism in the opposite meridian. If oblique cylinder is present in the over-refraction, you must use the crossed cylinder formula to calculate lens power."

      "explanation": "It is not always possible to have the correct diagnostic contact lens on hand. When this situation occurs, it is best to focus on power and axis because this will give you, as the practitioner, a good idea of how the lens will fit on the eye. If the lens is stable with good movement and coverage, an over-refraction will confirm the amount of astigmatism that is needed. If the lens is not stable and does not drape the cornea appropriately, then an over-refraction to confirm the astigmatism is unpredictable."

A contact lens that has rotated 15 degrees away from its axis will display an over-refraction with astigmatism that is equal to 1/2 of the original power located at an oblique angle. A lens that has rotated 30 degrees away from its proper axis will reveal the full amount of cylinder power in the over-refraction at an oblique angle."

After discussion, you decide to try Biofinity Toric monthly lenses. Which of the following prescriptions would you try first for his right eye?",

      "answers": [" -3.00 -1.25 x 180   "],
      "explanation": "When determining the initial toric contact lens prescription to try on a patient, it is first important to know the contact lens parameters that are available for the specific brand of lenses that you would like to use. Most soft toric contact lenses all have very similar parameters; 0.25D steps in the spherical component (0.50 steps with higher Rxs), cylinder component is in 0.50 steps (starting with 0.75, up to 2.25 or 2.75 depending on brand), and cylinder axis is typically in 10-degree steps. &#10;For the above patient, the cylinder component is -1.50D, but this is not available in Biofinity toric lenses. The next closest cylinder prescriptions available would be -1.25D or -1.75D, and the rule is to typically use the lower cylinder value. Therefore, for this patient, we would use -1.25D cyl. When it comes to axis determination, this patient is between 170 and 180 but is closer to 180 degrees, so we would begin with a 180-degree axis lens. It is also appropriate to keep the same sphere power of -3.00D, as we are only adjusting the cylinder power by 0.25, and this is not enough to need to adjust the sphere power as well."

      "explanation": "This is an application of the SAM-FAP rule (steepen add minus - flatten add plus). If the patient was to be prescribed a 7.76 mm (43.50 D) base curve, you would order a -5.00 D contact lens power (-3.75 D (+) -1.25 D = -5.00D). However, the base curve you are ordering, 7.63 mm (44.25 D), is 0.75 D steeper. Since you are steepening the base curve by 0.75 D, you need to compensate for the change in tear lens by the same amount. Steepen add minus (SAM-FAP) by 0.75 D in this case (-5.00 D (+) -0.75 D = -5.75 D)."

If the phoropter was placed 13 mm from the corneal plane, which of the following contact lens prescriptions would be the BEST choice for the right eye of this patient?",

      "answers": [" -4.25 -1.75 x 180   "],
      "explanation": "To determine the proper power, you must calculate the power at the corneal rather than the spectacle plane by utilizing the vertex power formula. Vertexing is used when the power in any meridian exceeds +/- 4.00 D. In order to properly vertex, one must use the following formula: Fc= Fs/1-dFs where Fc= the dioptric power at the corneal plane, Fs= the dioptric power at the spectacle plane, and d is the vertex distance in meters. In general,the vertex distance of the phoropter from the corneal plane is 13 mm unless otherwise specified. You must place the refractive components on an optical cross and vertex each meridian separately. The power in the 180 meridian is -4.50. Vertexing this component using the above equation is Fc= -4.50/1-(0.013)(-4.50), Fc= -4.50/1-(-0.0585), Fc= -4.50/1.0585, Fc= -4.251; rounding to the nearest 0.25 Fc is -4.25. Next, to calculate the power in the vertical meridian one must vertex -6.75. Again, using the same formula Fc= -6.50/1-(0.013)(-6.50), Fc= -6.50/1-(-0.0845), Fc= -6.50/1.0845, Fc=-5.994 or -6.00. The new vertexed prescription becomes -4.25-1.75 x 180. Remember when vertexing that as one gets closer to the corneal plane the power always decreases in minus power. Therefore, a minus prescription becomes less minus and a plus prescription becomes more plus."

      "answers": [" 8.6 mm   "],
      "explanation": "In order to determine the proper base curve, one must first determine the average keratometry reading which would be 44.50 D. To convert this reading from diopters to millimeters, one must divide 337.5 by the average keratometry readings. 337.5/44.50=7.58 mm. Rounding to the nearest tenth gives 7.6 mm. Soft contact lenses are typically fabricated flatter than the actual corneal curvature. In order to compensate for this factor, many authors suggest that adding 0.8 mm to 1.0 mm to the flat keratometry reading (or average K reading if the readings are close in magnitude) will allow for ideal movement of the lens. Applying this rule to our K reading yields 7.6 + 0.8 mm= 8.4 mm. The above choices do not have this number as an option. When faced with the decision to either go too flat or too steep, one should always error on the side of using a flatter-fitting lens. When a contact lens is fit too steeply, one risks sealing off the cornea because the contact lens acts like a suction cup and does not move when the patient blinks. Seal-off can cause corneal edema and/or neovascularization. The base curves of soft contact lenses are generally quite a bit flatter than the true corneal measurements; it is for this reason that keratometry tends not to play as much of a role with soft contact lenses as it does with rigid gas-permeable lenses. &#10;&#10;Ultimately, the definitive criteria for fitting a soft contact lens is how much lens movement is observed after several hours of wear on the eye. Lenses with the same base curve and diameter will often fit and move differently depending upon lens materials, center thickness and edge profile. The soft contact lens base curve/corneal curvature relationship is especially important for lenses fabricated of silicone hydrogel material due to their greater modulus values. &#10;&#10;Reference: &#10;Techniques for Improved Soft Lens Fitting.

      ],
      "answers": [" 7.63 mm / -1.50 D &#10;--------------------- &#10;8.11 mm / +1.12 D  "],
      "explanation": "Cylinder power effect (CPE) bitoric and base curve toric (with a spherical front-surface) gas-permeable (GP) lenses will induce unwanted cylinder if the lens rotates off axis. The resulting cylinder is due to cross-cylinder effects. However, a spherical power effect (bitoric) will not induce unwanted cylinder regardless of lens rotation. To determine whether a GP lens is a spherical power effect (SPE) or cylinder power effect (CPE) bitoric, measure the two base curves using a radiuscope and the two raw contact lens powers using a lensometer. If the difference between the two base curve meridians in diopters is the same as the difference between the two raw powers, the lens is an SPE bitoric. This is the case for only one of the above answers. Converting mm of base curve radius to diopters results in 7.63 mm = 44.25 D and 8.11 mm = 41.62; a difference of 2.62 D. The difference between the two raw powers of +1.12 D and -1.50 D is also 2.62 D. Therefore, this lens is a spherical power effect (SPE) bitoric GP contact lens."

      "explanation": "The edge profile is essential in achieving patient comfort. Remember, every time the patient blinks, the eyelids are going to move across that lens, and if the edge is uncomfortable or excessively sharp, the patient will definitely feel it. There are two types of edge profiles that ensure maximal comfort, a round edge and a plus edge. Both of these edges are smooth and slightly round allowing for a smooth transition of the lid over the lens upon blinking. A blunt edge is a straight edge that one would find on an uncut lens. A V-cut occurs when the lens is placed concave side down upon a cutting tool. An A-cut edge results when a lens is placed concave side up on a cutting/finishing tool. A knife edge is very thin and sharp."

      "answers": [" Alternating  "],
      "explanation": "Fused crescent bifocal rigid gas-permeable (RGP) contact lenses are fit as an alternating design. The appearance of the contact lens is similar to that of a bifocal spectacle lens in which there is a segment positioned in the inferior portion of the lens that posses a higher index of refraction than that of the main portion of the contact lens. The effectiveness of this type of lens is based on the idea that as the patient views in primary gaze, the pupil will be in the area of the distance Rx; further, as the patient looks down, the lens catches on the lower lid and stays in position while the pupil moves down into the add portion. In order for this to work properly, these lenses are typically prism ballasted so that to segment does not rotate, and truncated so as to catch on the lower lid. With this idea, the patient is 'alternating' viewing through the distance and near portion of the lens as desired."

      "explanation": "The most common symptoms associated with giant papillary conjunctivitis include mild itching and redness, mucous discharge, decreased contact lens wearing time due to increased lens intolerance, increased lens awareness, and excessive contact lens movement. The increased amounts of mucous production tend to coat the contact lenses, and patients will report a clouding of the vision after a few hours of wear time. Treatment involves switching to daily disposable contact lenses, adding protein remover to the cleaning regimen, changing to a hydrogen peroxide-based solution, polishing rigid lenses or prosthetics, and prescribing mast cell stabilizers or topical steroids if necessary. &#10;&#10;Infiltrative keratitis will typically cause symptoms of pain, watering and photophobia.

      ],
      "answers": [" Base curve: 43.12 D / Contact lens power: +2.75 D  "],
      "explanation": "A common fitting philosophy for gas-permeable contact lenses is to use the average keratometry value minus 0.75 diopters. This is based upon the idea that the cornea is an aspheric surface with an eccentricity of close to 0.50. Therefore, to achieve an apical alignment fit on a surface with this type of curvature, the base curve of the contact lens must be flatter than the central cornea curvature (if the cornea was spherical, an alignment base curve would be equal to the average keratometry value). Assuming a corneal eccentricity of 0.50 and a contact lens optic zone diameter of 7.4mm, the base curve of an alignment-fitting lens should be close to 0.75 diopters flatter than the average keratometry reading. Another common fitting philosophy is to fit the contact lens so that the base curve is equal to the flat keratometry value (this would provide the same answer in the above case). &#10;&#10;Therefore, in the above patient, the base curve of a diagnostic contact lens that would provide a predicted fluorescein pattern of apical alignment would be 43.12 D. &#10;Average K= (44.62 + 43.12) / 2 = 43.87 &#10;Average K -0.75D = 43.87 - 0.75 = 43.12 &#10;&#10;When determining the contact lens power that would provide a predicted spherical over-refraction of plano, the spherical portion of the subjective refraction, flat keratometry value, and base curve of the contact lens are utilized for calculations. First, one must determine the effect of the tear layer created between the anterior corneal surface and back surface of the contact lens using the flat keratometry and contact lens base curve values. If the contact lens is fit flatter than K, a minus tear power is created; therefore, a corresponding change in plus power is necessary. On the other hand, if the lens is fit steeper than K, a plus tear lens is created that must be compensated by adding minus to the contact lens power. &#10;&#10;In the above case, the contact lens base curve for ideal apical alignment was determined to be 43.12, which also corresponds to the patient's flat K reading. When the contact lens is fit 'on K,' or equal to the flat keratometry reading, the predicted lens power will be equal to the spherical portion of the subjective refraction (this must be vertexed if above 4D). Therefore; in order to provide a predicted over-refraction of plano, a diagnostic contact lens with a base curve of 43.12 should have a power of +2.75D."

      "explanation": "The most common complication associated with rigid gas-permeable contact lens wear is peripheral corneal desiccation, also known as 3-9 staining. In most cases, the patient reports only mild symptoms of interpalpebral redness and slight irritation. Slit lamp examination will reveal superficial punctate staining that can vary from small areas of non-coalescing SPK to larger coalescing areas of SPK, with deep fluorescein staining that can result in dellen formation. These signs are often due to excessive edge lift of the contact lenses which results in areas of tear film disruption, leading to areas of dryness and disruption of the corneal epithelium. In order to minimize these signs and symptoms, adjustments can be made to the fit of the contact lenses in order to decrease the edge lift and increase the lid apposition to the peripheral cornea. Steepening the base curve of the contact lens and/or steepening the peripheral curves of the contact lens will aid in achieving this objective. Additionally, thinning the contact lens edge and lenticulating higher minus lenses will also help. Studies have shown that the 3-9 staining is purely fit related, and changing the material of the lens has no benefit in reducing corneal signs."

      "explanation": "Front surface (F1) toric rigid gas-permeable (RGP) contact lenses are the only toric contact lenses that always have a prism-ballast design. The back surface of an F1 toric RGP lens is spherical, due to the fact that a patient wearing this design will have a mostly spherical cornea (usually less than about 1.00D). Patients will also have a significant amount of cylinder on over-refraction, so the toricity is placed on the front surface of the lens. In order for the lens to sit properly on the eye so that the lens power is oriented properly, F1 toric lenses have a prism-ballast design, making them heavier at the bottom. These are the only toric RGP lenses that always have this design. Therefore, one can determine that if prism is present, the lens design is most likely an F1 toric. Prism is rarely added to other lens designs to aid in lens centration.

      "explanation": "A front surface, prism ballast, toric gas-permeable contact lens is indicated in a patient that presents with a low amount of corneal toricity (typically less than or equal to 1.00D) and, when tested with a spherical rigid lens, reveals an unacceptable amount of residual astigmatism in the over-refraction (usually greater than or equal to 1.00D). These findings indicate the presence of residual or lenticular astigmatism that will need correcting in order to optimize visual acuity. Because the corneal curvature is essentially spherical, a gas-permeable lens with back surface toricity will not align properly on the cornea; therefore, the most appropriate way of overcoming the uncorrected cylinder issue is to order a toric front surface contact lens for the patient. &#10;&#10;Contact Lens Optics and Lens Design (3rd ed.).

      "explanation": "Removing the contact lens for several hours will typically allow for resolution of dimple veiling and any associated symptoms. Long-term treatment, however, will require modification of the contact lens parameters. Dimple veiling is a result of poor tear exchange under the gas permeable contact lens, which leads to the entrapment of bubbles of carbon dioxide under the central curvature of the lens. Decreasing the overall diameter of the contact lens and flattening the base curve of the lens may help prevent the formation of dimple veiling, but the treatment of choice is to decrease the diameter of the optic zone or in some manner reduce the vault of the lens. This allows for better tear flow that may have been impeded by a tight mid-peripheral junction of the optic zone and intermediate and peripheral curvatures of the contact lens. &#10;&#10;Dellen and Dimple Veiling.

      "explanation": "A corneal dellen is a localized area of thinning of the corneal epithelium, Bowman's layer, and stroma. It is caused by desiccation or dehydration of the peripheral cornea secondary to tear film instability adjacent to an area of elevation (e.g. pinguecula, pterygium, or gas-permeable contact lens). In these cases, slit-lamp evaluation of the cornea will reveal a saucer-shaped depression near the limbus that pools with fluorescein (minimal staining). There will not be any associated infiltrates, anterior chamber reaction, or hyperemia. Most patients are asymptomatic because this finding is not inflammatory or infectious in nature. Treatment typically includes copious amounts of lubrication and contact lens modifications (if this is the cause).&#10;PowerPage&#10;Dellen"

      "question": "A new patient is seen at your office and has worn gas-permeable lenses for years. He is very happy with the vision and the comfort of his current lenses. Biomicroscopy reveals nasal and temporal injection along with a slight loss of corneal transparency at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions on the cornea.

      "answers": [" Increase the overall diameter of the lens   "],
      "explanation": "Peripheral corneal desiccation syndrome, also known as 3-9 staining, can occur in patients who wear rigid lenses. It can be caused by incomplete blinking, excessive edge lift or poor lens design, to name a few. Slit lamp exam will generally reveal hyperemia at the nasal and temporal aspects of the cornea, usually due to poor tear distribution and subsequent desiccation. If left alone these areas can lose transparency and may slough epithelium, causing an indentation on the corneal surface called a dellen. One can decrease the occurrence of 3-9 staining by increasing the overall diameter of the lenses, decreasing the edge thickness to allow a more even distribution of tears, steepening of the secondary curve, or refitting the patient into a soft contact lens. Some suggest that adding ocular lubricants helps with this issue, but this may be of little value since the problem is created by a poorly fitted lens."

One option is to decrease the amount of time that the patient wears their contact lenses. In this case it would be ideal if the patient did not sleep in her lenses, especially given the fact that her lenses have a low Dk/t. Sleeping in contact lenses increases the risk of keratitis and patients should be persuaded to use daily wear contact lenses, which require very little maintenance. Another way to decrease neovascularization is to re-fit the patient in a lens that possesses a higher Dk/t, allowing more oxygen to reach the cornea. The best alternative to decrease neovascularization is to pull the patient out of contact lenses.

      "answers": [" Overall stability  "],
      "explanation": "A toric lens MUST offer stability if it is to perform optimally. Lens markings help to determine lens movement and orientation, but they in themselves do not affect vision. Because toric lenses deliver power in a specific meridian, it is essential that the lens does not rotate or change orientation, as this will alter acuity. Lens stability becomes more significant with higher levels of astigmatism. A lens that is meant to correct 1.25 D of astigmatism that is rotated 15 degrees off axis will induce roughly 0.62 D of astigmatism. A lens that is meant to correct 4.00 D of astigmatism if it is rotated 15 degrees off axis will induce approximately 2.00 D of astigmatism!"

      "answers": [" Less resistant to protein deposits on the lens  ", " Wettability of the lens decreases   ", " Lenses are more likely to scratch   "],
      "explanation": "A high Dk rigid gas-permeable (RGP) contact lens will allow greater oxygen permeability, thereby allowing more oxygen to reach the corneal surface. This is beneficial in that corneal physiology is typically superior with a higher Dk lens, and there tend to be fewer complications that can result from lower amounts of oxygen (inflammation, neovascularization, etc.). &#10;However, there are disadvantages to high Dk RGP contact lenses. High Dk lenses tend to be less durable than lower Dk lenses. Thus they are more prone to warpage and flexure and are more likely to scratch. Because of this, these lenses often need to be replaced on a more regular basis. Additionally, higher Dk lenses are also more likely to develop protein deposits and typically have worse wettability than a lens with a lower Dk value."

They generally occur with silicone hydrogel lenses that are fit too flat and are used for extended wear purposes. Mucin balls do not actually pose a threat to vision and do not generally compromise the integrity of the cornea. However, if they are severe enough, there are several options available to clinicians to combat their formation. An easy way to decrease generation of mucin balls is to steepen the base curve of the lens. Alternatively, one can decrease the amount of extended wear or add re-wetting drops to the patient's contact lens regimen. Upon removal, mucin balls will cause pooling of sodium fluorescein but will not cause staining of the cornea."

      "explanation": "Increasing the size of the optic zone or overall lens diameter increases the sagittal height of the lens, thereby steepening the fitting relationship on the cornea. To compensate for this steepening, you prescribe a flatter base curve. The clinical rule-of-thumb generally used for gas-permeable (GP) lenses is that you change the base curve by 0.25 D for every 0.5 mm change in optic zone or overall diameter. If you increase the diameter, you flatten the base curve; if you decrease the diameter, you steepen the base curve. Keep in mind that when you change the base curve you will need to apply the rule SAM-FAP rule (Steep Add Minus-Flat Add Plus) to the contact lens power.

      "question": "Your 50 year-old patient currently wears soft contact lenses as monovision with the right eye distance and left eye near. Manifest refraction is OD: -2.00 -0.50 x 180 and OS: -2.25 -0.50 x 180. If the patient requires a +1.75D add, what would you expect the over-refraction to be if spherical soft lenses were placed on the eyes to allow for this type of vision?",
      "options": [" OD: +2.00 -0.50 x 180 OS: +0.25 -0.50 x 180  ", " OD: -1.50 -0.50 x 180 OS: +0.25 -0.50 x 180  ", " OD: +0.25 -0.50 x 180 OS: -1.50 -0.50 x 180  ", " OD: +0.25 -0.50 x 180 OS: +2.00 -0.50 x 180  "],

      "explanation": "In the above case, the patient wishes to wear monovision contact lenses, with right eye distance and left eye near with a +1.75 effective add. &#10;Because the right eye is to be used for distance, her over-refraction should be plano equivalent sphere (EDS) for the right eye. She does show -0.50 cylinder on refraction, so it will also likely present in the over-refraction as well. Therefore, in order to give the best possible distance vision in this eye, we would expect the over-refraction to be +0.25 -0.50 x 180 (plano EDS). &#10;The left eye is to be used for near and the patient requires a +1.75 add power to achieve her best reading vision. Therefore, in order to achieve this, we would expect the over-refraction to be -1.75 equivalent sphere (EDS). However, she also has -0.50D of cylinder in her left eye that will need to be taken into consideration; this will then produce an expected over-refraction of -1.50 -0.50 x 180 (-1.75 EDS)."

      "question": "It is decided that monovision is the best option for this 51-year old patient who requires a +1.75 D add. Testing reveals that the right eye is dominant. You prescribe the rigid gas-permeable (RGP) contact lenses to fit alignment on both eyes. What contact lens powers would you order?",

      "answers": [" OD= -3.50 D; OS= -2.62 D  "],
      "explanation": "The right eye's trial lens fitting relationship is already alignment, so you would add the equivalent sphere of the OR (-0.62 D) to the power of the trial lens (-2.87). This results in a power of -3.50 D. Since the right eye is dominant and will be correcting distance vision and the fitting relationship of the trial lens is alignment, you do not need to further adjust the lens power. &#10;&#10;For the left eye, adding the trial lens power (-3.25 D) to the OR (-0.75DS) results in a power of -4.00 D. You would order this power if you were prescribing a 42.87 D base curve for distance viewing. However, you desire to prescribe a 43.25 D base curve to achieve an alignment fitting relationship. To compensate for the steeper base curve, you will need to adjust the power by -0.37 D, resulting in a distance correcting power of -4.37 D (SAM-FAP). To prescribe a near monovision lens for the left (non-dominant) eye, you add the add power (+1.75 D) to the -4.37 D value. The final contact lens power for the left eye will be -2.62 D."

At a follow-up visit one year later, the patient's visual acuity is 20/30 with her spectacle blur (manifest) refraction and 20/15 with the contact lens over-refraction.

      "answers": [" Corneal distortion secondary to GP contact lens wear   "],
      "explanation": "If a patient achieves visual acuities of 20/15 through both her spectacle prescription and GP contact lenses, neither the 'internal' portion of the eye nor the cornea are decreasing the patient's vision. If the patient's VAs are 20/40 through both her spectacle prescription and GP contact lenses, the reduction in vision is caused by an internal condition such as macular degeneration or a cataract. The decreased acuity may also be due to an external factor such as corneal scarring. If the patient's VAs are 20/40 through her spectacle prescription and 20/15 through her GP contact lenses, the patient probably has an irregular corneal surface such as keratoconus. If the patient's VA's through her spectacle prescription is 20/15 and 20/40 through her GP lenses, the reduction in contact lens VA is probably caused by a dirty or distorted GP contact lens."

      "explanation": "Rubbing with a cleaner or multi-purpose solution containing a surfactant will remove lipid deposits that are not bound to the lens surface.

There were many reports of cytotoxicity to the corneal epithelium, leading to Type IV hypersensitivity and patient discomfort. &#10;&#10;Enzyme treatment utilizing papain- or pancreatin-based products attacks denatured tear proteins accumulated on the lens surface or in the lens matrix. Heat-based care systems tended to denature proteins onto the lens surface. &#10;&#10;Most current hydrogen peroxide-based lens care systems do not contain a rubbing component to the procedure.

      "explanation": "The first measurement that should be made when analyzing RGP contact lenses is lensometry. Lenses should be placed concave side down on the aperture stop, and the power and axis wheels should be rotated until mires are clear and lined up. If cylinder is present, powers should be recorded in both major meridians (record gross amounts). After lensometry, lenses should be analyzed using the radiuscope. Again, once the sharpest focus of mires is found, both base curves should be measured and recorded. Base curves should be converted from millimeters to diopters. The steep meridian is recorded over the flat meridian, and the most plus meridian goes with the flat meridian. &#10;&#10;For the above patient, the measurements are as follows: &#10;46.25 -6.00 &#10;44.75 -3.75 &#10;The next step is to determine the values of the difference in base curves and the difference in contact lens power. For this patient, the difference in base curves is 1.50D and the difference in contact lens power is 2.25D. &#10;- If the difference in base curve is multiplied by 3/2 and that value is equivalent to the contact lens power then you have a Toric Base Curve lens (with spherical front surface) &#10;o For this patient (3/2) x (1.50) = 2.25 and difference in CL power = 2.25 &#10;o 2.25 = 2.25 therefore, this is a Toric Base Curve lens design &#10;o Note that 'equivalent' is defined as less than or equal to 0.50D &#10;- If the difference in base curve is equal to the difference in contact lens power then you have a spherical power effect (SPE) bitoric lens design &#10;- If the difference in base curve is not equivalent to the difference in CL power, and 3/2 x the difference in base curve is also not equal to the difference in CL power then you have a cylinder power effect (CPE) bitoric lens"

      "question": "Your 23 year-old rigid gas-permeable contact lens wearer returns to your office for a contact lens follow-up after wearing his new lenses for about 2 weeks. During slit-lamp evaluation you notice several circular, well-demarcated indentations of the central cornea that pool with fluorescein. What is the name of this finding?",
      "options": [" Superficial punctate keratitis  ", " Dellen  ", " Dimple veiling  ", " 3-9 staining  "],
      "answers": [" Dimple veiling  "],
      "explanation": "Dimple veiling is a finding that occurs almost exclusively in rigid gas-permeable contact lens wearers (but can occur with scleral lenses due to mucin ball formation). Several circular, well-demarcated indentations are found in the cornea, either central or peripheral, that pool with fluorescein (they do not stain, as they do not represent breaks in the corneal epithelium). Dimple veiling is caused by a sub-optimal fitting relationship of a rigid gas-permeable contact lens in which tiny air bubbles that become trapped beneath the contact lens and are then mechanically compressed by the lens, indenting the cornea. Patients are typically asymptomatic; however, if sufficient in number, the dimples may interfere with vision, producing glare, hazy vision, and/or a loss of contrast sensitivity. &#10;&#10;Dimple veiling is transient and will resolve within a few hours if the contact lens is removed from the cornea. Longer-term treatment involves modification of the fitting relationship of the contact lens, such as flattening the base curve, decreasing the optical zone diameter, blending the junction between the base curve and peripheral curve, or steepening the peripheral curves to allow for better tear exchange beneath the lens. &#10;&#10;Dimple veiling has also been shown to occur in a few cases of soft contact lens wear. In these cases, mucin balls composed of mucus, lipids, and proteins can build up on the contact lens and create a similar corneal finding."

      "options": [" Superior steepening and central flattening  ", " Against-the-rule astigmatism  ", " Pseudo-radial keratotomy  ", " Central steepening and inferior flattening  ", " Pseudo-keratoconus   "],
      "answers": [" Pseudo-keratoconus   "],
      "explanation": "Lid attached GP lenses are often prescribed with a flat or apical touch fitting relationship. Because the GP lens positions superiorly, this will tend to result in a physical flattening of the superior cornea and a steepening of the inferior cornea. The topography map will be similar in appearance to keratoconus. To verify that the topography is due to the GP fit as opposed to keratoconus, lens deprivation or refitting with a more center lens position will slowly change the topography to a more normal image. Also, keratoconus patients often have clinical corneal signs of striae, Fleisher's ring, and/or corneal scarring, indicative of keratoconus."

      "explanation": "The above lens was fit with excess apical clearance. Increased levels of clearance can interfere with corneal metabolism. In order to solve this problem, one must flatten the base curve of the lens. A flatter base curve will bring the contact lens closer to the apex of the cornea and also flatten out the peripheral curves in order to ensure adequate peripheral clearance."

      "explanation": "The presence of dimple veiling in a patient wearing rigid gas-permeable contact lenses occurs secondary to tiny air bubbles that become trapped beneath the lens. These air bubbles are then mechanically compressed by the contact lens, causing indentations in the anterior surface of the cornea. &#10;&#10;Soft contact lens wearers may also show signs of dimple veiling; however, this finding in these patients is due to spherical particles consisting of mucous, lipids, and proteins, that build-up on the contacts and press on the cornea. Dimple veiling from mucin balls can also occur in RGP wearers, but it is much less likely than dimple veiling caused by air bubble formation."

      "explanation": "Studies have demonstrated that NCT performed over soft contact lenses generally does not affect the results unless the power of the lens is greater than +3.00 D due to increased center thickness (and therefore increased rigidity). Lenses greater than +3.00 D cause a falsely elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) when NCT is performed over the contact lenses. Research has also purported that when NCT is performed over minus-powered soft contact lenses (greater than -6.00 D), the IOP tends to be underestimated, with a direct relationship between increasing degree of myopia and increased underestimated values. &#10;&#10;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16303525 &#10;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19593202"

      "explanation": "When a soft contact lens dehydrates, the contact lens power increases in minus, the overall diameter and the thickness decrease while the index of refraction increases. Clinically, it is important to monitor the base curve because as a contact lens dehydrates, its base curve steepens, especially in people with dry eyes. When a contact lens steepens, it can tighten up and can seal off the cornea, causing edema as well as eye infections. In contrast, when a soft contact lens is hydrated, its base curve flattens, the overall diameter and the thickness increase, the contact lens power increases in plus, and the index of refraction decreases."

When altering a base curve, one must also adjust the prescription due to changes in the tear film. Flattening the base curve of a lens induces a minus tear film; therefore, to offset this power change one must add plus power to the prescription. On the other hand, steepening of the base curve induces a plus tear film and therefore must be compensated for by adding minus to the prescription."

As the Dk increases, the lens also becomes less durable and can become prone to scratching, flexure, and warping."

      "explanation": "The amount of time that a patient needs to be out of their contact lenses prior to refractive surgery varies from patient to patient and surgeon to surgeon. In regards to rigid gas-permeable contact lenses, a good starting point is to let the patient know that on average, they will need to discontinue their contact lenses for about 1 month per decade of RGP contact lens wear. So, for the above patient, one could estimate that it may take about 8 weeks for the cornea to stabilize. However, time is not really the issue here. What is important is that the refraction, keratometry, and topography values are all stable prior to undergoing surgery. For some people this can take much less or much more time than expected."

Again, once the sharpest focus of mires is found, both base curves should be measured and recorded. Base curves should be converted from millimeters to diopters.

This will aid in determining which type of RGP lens is best for your patient, depending on the patient's corneal toricity and residual over-refraction cylinder values (when a spherical GP diagnostic lens is placed on the eye). &#10;&#10;The above patient presents with 3.25 diopters of corneal cylinder, which is typically above the threshold for a spherical RGP contact lens. Although a spherical lens would provide a low cylinder over-refraction (as shown when a diagnostic lens is placed on the eye), the fit of a spherical lens on a cornea with over 2.50 D of toricity would not be ideal. Because the above patient has high amounts of corneal astigmatism and a very low amount of cylinder on over-refraction, a spherical power effect (SPE) bitoric lens would be the most appropriate option. An SPE bitoric lens will improve the fit of the contact lens with a toric surface but will not change the cylinder amount on over-refraction. &#10;&#10;The spherical power effect lens has a toric curve on the front surface of the contact lens to compensate for the astigmatic power induced by the toric back surface of the lens.

      "question": "Your 54 year-old female patient wishes to wear soft contact lenses as monovision. She currently wears distance contact lenses in both eyes, is right eye dominant, and requires a +2.00 add power. Based on the following data, which of the following contact lenses would you prescribe for each eye? ",

      "answers": [" OD: -2.50 OS: +1.00  "],
      "explanation": "Because the above patient is right eye dominant, her right eye would be considered the distance eye and the left eye would be used for near vision. &#10;The patient is currently wearing distance Rx in both eyes, and distance over-refraction is plano in the right eye; therefore we would keep the right contact lens prescription the same in this eye (-2.50). &#10;For the left eye, the patient is also wearing distance Rx, and the distance over-refraction has a plano equivalent sphere. In order to determine the near Rx for this eye, we would simply add the near requirement to her current distance Rx; -1.00 +2.00 = +1.00."

      "question": "Your 28 year-old female patient wears rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. The following parameters are for her right eye: &#10;Keratometry: 44.50 @ 090 x 43.50 @ 180 &#10;Base curve of RGP: 43.25D (apical alignment with 1.00D of with-the-rule toricity) &#10;Which 2 of the following would you expect to occur to the apical relationship if you suspect that her contact lens is warped by 0.50D?

      "explanation": "When a rigid gas-permeable contact lens warps, the apical relationship will not change. If a lens is apical alignment and the lens warps by any amount, the average base curve will remain the same; therefore, the apical relationship will continue to be apical alignment. On the other hand, the amount of toricity present when analyzing the fitting relationship will change; the toricity will decrease by the amount of warpage. &#10;&#10;In the above example, if the RGP lens warped by 0.50D, the apical relationship will remain the same (apical alignment), and the amount of toricity will decrease by the amount of warpage (from 1.00D to 0.50D)."

This results in a power of -3.50 D. Since the right eye is dominant and will be correcting distance vision and the fitting relationship of the trial lens is alignment, you do not need to further adjust the lens power. &#10;&#10;For the left eye, adding the trial lens power (-3.25 D) to the OR (-0.75DS) results in a power of -4.00 D. You would order this power if you were prescribing a 42.87 D base curve for distance viewing. However, you desire to prescribe a 43.25 D base curve to achieve an alignment fitting relationship. To compensate for the steeper base curve, you will need to adjust the power by -0.37 D, resulting in a distance correcting power of -4.37 D (SAM-FAP). To prescribe a near monovision lens for the left (non-dominant) eye, you add the add power (+1.75 D) to the -4.37 D value. The final contact lens power for the left eye will be -2.62 D."

      "explanation": "The forced-choice preferential looking test enlists gratings instead of optotypes and does not require the patient to respond verbally, making it ideal for those that are physically unable to orally participate. The examiner displays two stimuli, one is a grey pattern; the other is a grating. Both stimuli possess equal average luminance profiles. Infants prefer looking at gratings rather than a homogenous background, so the infant's eyes will gravitate towards the grating so long as they can resolve it. The examiner views the child's eyes while observing through a peephole. The examiner is not privy as to which side contains the grating and therefore must guess using the preferred gaze of the infant. This is repeated again with the same grating (mixing up the side of placement so that the examiner does not know where the grating is located). The results are then plotted to determine the infant's grating acuity. &#10;&#10;To determine the Snellen acuity, simply divide 600 by 6. The result will be the Snellen denominator. 600/6=100, therefore 20/100 is the Snellen fraction of the infant."

      "options": [" Inferior  ", " Nasal  ", " Superior  ", " Temporal  "],
      "answers": [" Temporal  "],
      "explanation": "The retina is a unique tissue due to the fact that it is avascular until about the fourth month of gestation. At this time, arteries and veins begin to emanate from the hyaloid vessels at the optic disc and grow towards the peripheral retina. These blood vessels ultimately first reach the nasal periphery after 8 months gestation. The last area to become vascularized is the temporal retina, which occurs about 1 month after birth. The incompletely developed retinal vascular system at birth is what causes a premature infant to be particularly susceptible to oxygen damage, which can lead to the development of retinopathy of prematurity."

      "explanation": "The contrast sensitivity function of an infant shifts up and to the right as the infant grows. This makes sense intuitively because as the resolution acuity progressively improves, the high spatial frequency cut-off of the infant will also increase, inducing a right shift of the curve. The peak of the curve reaches adult levels (4 cycles per degree) by roughly six months of age."

      "answers": [" Anophthalmos   "],
      "explanation": "Anophthalmos is when no eye forms. It can occur if the optic vesicle either fails to form as an outgrowth of the wall of the diencephalon or if the optic vesicle does not reach the surface ectoderm due to interference with closure of the neural tube during expansion of the optic vesicle. &#10;&#10;Microphthalmia is when a normal but smaller eye develops; it occurs when the optic vesicle contacts a smaller than normal area of the surface ectoderm. &#10;&#10;Congenital glaucoma likely has a complex pathogenesis but is associated with a poorly differentiated, thickened trabecular meshwork. &#10;&#10;A keratolenticular stalk is a persistent stalk connecting the lens to the cornea and occurs when the lens vesicle fails to detach from the surface ectoderm. A keratolenticular stalk is characteristically seen in Peter's anomaly. &#10;&#10;Iris coloboma involves the pigment epithelium and stroma giving rise to a keyhole pupil; it results from incomplete closure of the choroidal fissure. &#10;&#10;&#10;Ref: Trachimowicz, R.

      "options": [" Neural ectoderm  ", " Mesoderm  ", " Endoderm  ", " Surface ectoderm  "],
      "answers": [" Surface ectoderm  "],
      "explanation": "Unlike the rest of the human eye, which is mostly derived from the neural ectoderm, the crystalline lens is formed from surface ectoderm. &#10;&#10;The first stage of lens differentiation begins at the 4mm embryonic stage, in which the lens plate (placode) forms from surface ectoderm adjacent to the optic vesicle (formed from neural ectoderm), beginning around day 27 of development. At this stage, the lens placode is a single monolayer of columnar cells. As development progresses, the outer surface of the lens plate deepens and invaginates to form a lens pit, which continues to invaginate until it forms the lens vesicle. By the 10mm stage, the lens vesicle completely separates from the surface ectoderm (around day 33) and forms a hollow sphere consisting of a single layer of cells. After the lens vesicle is formed, posterior epithelial cells become the primary lens fibers and form the embryonic lens nucleus at the center of the developing lens. The anterior cells stay in place at this time, and the equatorial cells divide and elongate to form secondary lens fibers around the embryonic nucleus. The lens capsule is apparent at about 5 weeks; it originates from the basement membrane of the surface ectoderm and from secretions of the lens epithelium."

The optic pits are indentations that form along the neural tube near the forebrain region. Around day 25, the optic pits form sac-shaped extensions that gradually separate from it; these are known as optic vesicles. As an optic vesicle invaginates, the optic stalk is formed from the tissue joining the optic vesicle to the neural tube. The retinal disc is formed by thickening and flattening of the optic vesicle. The optic vesicle and stalk invaginate inward, forming the optic fissure (also known as the embryonic fissure, choroidal fissure, or fetal fissure). The edges of the optic fissure grow toward each other and start to fuse at about 5 weeks into development, closing at 7 weeks and forming the two-layered optic cup. &#10;&#10;Ref: Remington, LA.

The useful field of view assesses the elderly patient's ability to divide their attention between images that are foveally fixated and those that are seen simultaneously by the peripheral retina. Basically this test determines the extent of a person's visual attention to stimuli residing in the visual field. Obviously, individuals with a small useful field of vision are more likely to be implicated in a car accident. Although visual acuity and even visual fields are important tests to conduct, they do not explain why elderly patients are more frequently involved in auto accidents, nor can they be used as predictive values to assess accident related risk."

      "answers": [" 10-2   "],
      "explanation": "A patient with advanced glaucoma should be monitored using a threshold 10-2 test which tests 68 test points, 2 degrees apart in a central 10 degree area. Patients with advanced glaucoma possess a central island of vision, and therefore it is important to monitor for change within this region. A 40 point screener, 30-2 or 24-2 threshold visual field presents too many test points that lay outside of the patient's area of useable vision and therefore do not provide useful information. A 30-2 field tests 76 points, 6 degrees apart within a central 30 degree radius. A 24-2 field presents a total of 54 points within a central 24 degree region (except nasally where it extends out to 30 degrees). When treating patients with advanced glaucoma, the objective is to save the central acuity. If the glaucoma is not adequately controlled, progression will cause a splitting of fixation due to inward advancement of the superior nasal field defect followed by inferior field loss due to encroachment of the nasal defect. &#10;&#10;References: &#10;Shared Care Glaucoma, A Clinical Text for Ophthalmic Allied Professionals.

      "explanation": "Argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) treatment typically takes about 4-6 weeks for best response. If intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction is significant at this time, gradual withdrawal of topical medications may be attempted. &#10;If IOP is still inadequate, the other 180 degrees of trabecular meshwork can be treated (if not having been done at the initial visit); alternately, filtration surgery should be considered (further ALT treatment is unlikely to be beneficial)."

IOP can fluctuate between 3-6 mmHg on a daily basis resulting most likely resulting from a change in aqueous production rather than aqueous drainage. This may be related to nocturnal hypotension. A fluctuation of greater than 10mmHg is usually indicative of glaucoma."

A white stimulus on a white background will not isolate any particular pathway, and all mechanisms will be stimulated. A blue stimulus on a yellow background suppresses the mid-range and long-range cones and selectively stimulates the blue/yellow opponent pathway or konio cellular pathway. A flickering target like that of frequency doubling technology readily isolates the magno cells, as they are the most sensitive to flicker."

      "explanation": "There are many potential sources of error when performing Goldmann applanation tonometry. If the mires created by the prisms in the tonometer are not aligned properly, the resulting IOP measurement will not be accurate. This also applies if too little or too much fluorescein is instilled. Too little fluorescein causes thin mires and an underestimation of the IOP reading. Too much fluorescein results in large mires and a falsely elevated measurement. If the mires are misaligned inferiorly (that is, the majority of the mires are located below the prism line) then the slit lamp needs to be lowered to center the mire images. If the mires are misaligned superiorly then the slit lamp needs to be raised to center the mires. &#10;&#10;A corneal abrasion may occur if the slit lamp is moved excessively or if too much force is placed by the tonometer head against the cornea."

      "explanation": "Functional progression occurs when the natural performance of the element in question has been altered. Functional glaucoma progression is measured via visual field testing. Any defects/changes observed on visual field testing should be re-tested to ensure that the defect/change is repeatable. Many times, observed misses will not occur upon re-testing. Many clinicians believe that it is important to perform many visual field tests during the first year of diagnosis to establish a proper baseline as well as to allow for the determination of the rate of progression. Although there is no current agreed up value that indicates if a patient displays a fast rate of progression, many clinicians consider a change of 1.5 decibels or greater per year to be a fast rate of progression. Newer software allows for easier detection of progression by comparing visual field results across time and extrapolating a graph of the visual field index. A steeper slope indicates a faster rate of progression. A Drance hemorrhage, superior notching of the rim tissue, and an abnormal OCT scan are considered structural signs of glaucoma progression. &#10;&#10;Review of Optometry. September 2013.

      "answers": [" Normal tension glaucoma   "],
      "explanation": "Optic disc hemorrhages occurring at the margin of the optic nerve are most commonly associated with normal tension glaucoma. These hemorrhages appear at the edge of the optic disc and typically extend onto the nerve fiber layer (called Drance hemorrhages). Additionally, they are most often found at the infero-temporal quadrant of the optic nerve head. It is thought that patients who exhibit progressive optic neuropathy with intraocular pressures (IOPs) consistently within the normal range are likely to have some form of vascular insufficiency or low systemic blood pressure which can lead to a decrease in the ocular perfusion pressure. It is for this reason that optic disc hemorrhages are more commonly observed in individuals exhibiting normal IOPs. When an optic disc hemorrhage is present, it is common to eventually manifest a visual field defect in the region corresponding to the location of the previous hemorrhage (often several months later)."

The beta zone directly borders the margin of the optic disc, while the alpha zone is the outer region that concentrically surrounds the beta zone. &#10;&#10;Chorioretinal atrophy that occurs in the beta zone will present with increased visibility of the sclera and large choroidal blood vessels, in contrast to the appearance of alpha zone atrophy, which displays an irregular variation of both hyper and hypopigmentation of the retinal pigmented epithelium. &#10;&#10;Typically, when comparing peripapillary atrophy characteristics in normal and glaucomatous patients, the alpha zone is usually larger in patients with glaucoma; however, its frequency is similar in both groups. Conversely, both the size and frequency of beta zone atrophy is greater in patients with glaucoma, and the changes appear to be more pronounced in more severely affected eyes."

      "answers": [" Paracentral scotoma   "],
      "explanation": "Characteristic defects in glaucoma consist of damage to the optic nerve head, resulting in a retinal nerve fiber bundle defect. The configuration of nerve fibers served by the damaged bundle will correspond to a specific defect in the visual field. The earliest visual field changes that may suggest glaucomatous damage commonly consist of an increased variability of responses in an area that will eventually develop a defect. &#10;&#10;When a glaucomatous visual field defect does occur, it tends to initially present as a paracentral scotoma. Paracentral scotomas are typically small and relatively steep depressions that are most commonly observed just supero-nasal to the fovea. Approximately 70% of all early glaucomatous field defects can be characterized as a paracentral scotoma. This type of defect is due to damage of the papillomacular bundle, which will respect the horizontal midline. &#10;&#10;It is important to remember that a single visual field test cannot definitively prove that a visual field defect exists. For this reason, interpretation of visual fields should not be performed in isolation but rather in conjunction with other clinical findings (IOP, appearance of optic nerve, RNFL). According to Kanski's Clinical Ophthalmology, there is a set of minimal criteria for determining glaucomatous damage (also known as Anderson's criteria), summarized below: &#10;&#10;1. Glaucoma hemifield test that is 'outside normal limits' on at least 2 consecutive occasions. &#10;2. A cluster of 3 or more non-edge points in a location typical for glaucoma, all of which are depressed on pattern standard deviation (PSD) at a P < 5% level and one of which is depressed at a P <1% level, on 2 consecutive occasions. &#10;3. Corrected pattern standard deviation (CPSD) that occurs in less than 5% of normal individuals on two consecutive fields."

      "answers": [" Brimonidine   "],
      "explanation": "Glaucoma medications lower intraocular pressure by either decreasing aqueous production or by increasing aqueous outflow. There are three classes of drugs for which the mechanism of action is increasing aqueous outflow: cholinergic agonists, prostaglandin analogs, and alpha-2 agonists. Cholinergic agonists, such as pilocarpine, work by increasing trabecular outflow, whereas prostaglandin analogs and alpha-2 agonists work by increasing uveoscleral outflow. The other classes of glaucoma medications, such as beta-blockers and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, work by decreasing aqueous production. &#10;&#10;It is important to note that alpha-2 agonists, such as Brimonidine (Alphagan®) and Apraclonidine (Iopidine®), have dual mechanisms of action.

Signs of prostaglandin-associated periorbitopathy include increased inferior scleral show, ptosis of the upper lid, dermatochalasis involution, slight enophthalmos, atrophy of periorbital fat cells, and a deepening of the superior lid sulcus. However, the most common initial side effect is conjunctival hyperemia. This side effect can be bothersome to many patients, and therefore it is important for the primary eye care provider to determine which prostaglandin analog is best suited for the patient. Studies have demonstrated that latanoprost may be associated with the least amount of conjunctival hyperemia. Conjunctival hyperemia is purportedly mediated by nitric-oxide causing vasodilation of the conjunctival vasculature. Typically, the level of hyperemia decreases with increased time and continued use of the medication. &#10;&#10;Reference: &#10;A randomized, controlled comparison of macroscopic conjunctival hyperemia in patients treated with bimatoprost 0.01% or vehicle who were previously controlled on latanoprost.

Biomicroscopy reveals a vertical line of pigment deposited on his posterior endothelium along with an iris transillumination defect. You correctly diagnose him with pigmentary dispersion syndrome. What is the name for the deposited pigment on his cornea?",

      "answers": [" Krukenberg spindle   "],
      "explanation": "Pigmentary dispersion syndrome generally occurs in young, myopic males with deep anterior chambers. This condition is caused by a disruption of the posterior iris pigment epithelium, causing this layer to rub against the ciliary zonules and release pigment into the anterior chamber and its associated structures. The aqueous in the anterior chamber displays convection currents. Warming inferiorly, aqueous rises and migrates forward towards the posterior surface of the endothelium, carrying pigment granules with it, then falls as it cools, causing the pigment to deposit vertically in a linear-fashion on the endothelium. Monitor these patients for blockage of the trabecular meshwork, causing a rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) and potential glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve. Physical exertion as well as mydriasis may exacerbate pigment release; therefore, when dilating (especially with phenylephrine), you must be sure to measure post-dilated IOPs. &#10;&#10;Siderosis appears as a brown/yellow iron deposit in the epithelium and/or stroma of the cornea secondary to a metal foreign body. &#10;&#10;Fleischer's ring occurs in keratoconus. This ring appears as brown/yellow iron pigmentation around the base of the ectasia. &#10;&#10;Cornea farinata appear as small white specks located in the interpalpebral zone of the posterior stroma. This condition is generally bilateral and does not require treatment. &#10;&#10;Corneal arcus appears as a white/yellow circular band of cholesterol that deposits in the stromal periphery, leaving a clear zone adjacent to the limbus. It is important to refer patients with corneal arcus who are unaware of their cholesterol levels for evaluation of their serum cholesterol."

      "question": "It has long been hypothesized that the ocular blood flow may in part play a role in mechanisms surrounding primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). When evaluating the contribution of perfusion pressure, a decrease in diastolic perfusion pressure causes the prevalence of primary open angle glaucoma to change in which manner?",
      "options": [" Decrease  ", " Increase   ", " No change  "],
      "answers": [" Increase   "],
      "explanation": "Perfusion pressure dictates how the blood reaches the end organs. There are two components to perfusion pressure: systolic and diastolic. If the perfusion pressure is low, blood flow to the capillaries is compromised. This holds true for either component of perfusion pressure. Thus, there is an increase in the prevalence of primary open angle glaucoma with a decrease in diastolic perfusion pressure."

      "explanation": "Early glaucomatous damage can be difficult to detect because intraocular pressure and visual fields can be normal. Recent studies demonstrate that the magno cells may be damaged early on in glaucoma. The magno cells are a part of the 'where' pathway and therefore display excellent temporal resolution. Due to this factor, there is evidence that clearly reveals a correlation between an altered temporal modulation transfer function and early glaucoma, with a marked decrease noted for the moderate and high temporal frequencies, even though the respective visual field is free of defects."

Some studies have shown that patients exhibiting a mild reaction to sulfa-based antimicrobial medications may be able to tolerate acetazolamide without risk, but a lesser dose test dose should be administered. This is not practical in the case of an acute angle closure, as the intraocular pressure must be reduced very quickly. In the event of a sulfa allergy, a non sulfa-containing diuretic should be utilized to err on the side of caution.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Oral Glaucoma Medications"

There are many factors that can result in a poor visual field result, such as: decreased patient attention, fatigue, lack of comprehension, or wrong/no visual correction in place, to name a few. If the pattern loss is specific and repeatable, then it is important to look for retinal pathology that correlates with the associated field loss, and take the appropriate actions (i.e. treat, monitor, or refer) at that time."

      "answers": [" FDT targets the magnocellular pathway, which is thought to be preferentially damaged in the early glaucoma process   "],
      "explanation": "Frequency doubling technology (FDT) perimetry utilizes a low spatial frequency sinusoidal grating combined with a high temporal frequency counterphase flicker to produce a stimulus target. The FDT has been shown to specifically activate the magnocellular ganglion cells in order to see this type of stimulus. This is of great importance due to the fact that the magnocellular pathway is thought to be preferentially damaged in the early glaucoma process. &#10;&#10;Recent studies have shown that the FDT demonstrates 85% sensitivity and 90% specificity for detecting early glaucomatous visual field loss, and 95% sensitivity and 95% specificity for detecting visual field loss in patients with moderate glaucomatous damage. Furthermore, this degree of effectiveness in early detection has allowed the FDT to reveal the presence of abnormalities in the visual field before they could be detected by standard automated perimetry. &#10;&#10;It is also believed that short-wave automated perimetry (SWAP) is able to detect early glaucomatous functional loss by isolating the small bistratified ganglion cells that have also been thought to be damaged early in the glaucoma process."

During the administration of visual fields, the stimulus is presented in the visual space at the location of patient's blind spot. Because this area of the eye does not possess receptors, it will not be able to perceive the light, and therefore the patient will not respond. However, if the patient undergoing perimetry either tilts their head, or if the fellow eye is not patched appropriately, this may influence the efficacy of the monitoring technique. This may result in decreased reliability of the test, as the patient will be able to respond from the seeing region around the optic disc of the ipsilateral eye or stimulation of the inappropriately patched contralateral eye."

      "options": [" Grade 4  ", " Grade 3  ", " Grade 2  ", " Grade 1   "],
      "answers": [" Grade 1   "],
      "explanation": "The Van Herick method of angle estimation, although not infallible, is a good way of assessing the probability of angle closure with dilation. The temporal angle of a patient is evaluated by having the patient look straight ahead, placing the oculars of the slit lamp in the straight ahead position and shifting the lighthouse temporally so that an angle of 60 degrees is created. The beam is then narrowed to an optic section and placed at the temporal limbus. The width of the anterior chamber space at the angle is then compared to the width of the corneal optic section. The procedure is repeated and the illumination source is placed nasally to assess the grade of the nasal angle. If the angle space is equal to 1/2 or greater than the corneal optic section, the angle is not considered occludable and is given a grade of 4. A grade three displays an angle space that is less than 1/2 but greater than 1/4 of the width of the corneal optic section, and is considered safe to dilate. A grade two has an angle space that is roughly equal to 1/4 the width of the corneal optic section, and may be dilated but with caution. A grade 1 has an angle space of less than 1/4 the width of the corneal optic section, and requires gonioscopy to ensure that the patient is safe to dilate. &#10;&#10;Reference: Casser, L., Fingeret, M., Woodcome, T.

      "answers": [" Grade 0   "],
      "explanation": "According to the Becker-Shaffer grading system, the ability to safely dilate a patient is determined by which ocular structure is visible most posteriorly. The anatomy of the angle of the anterior chamber is comprised of several structures. The most posterior of the structures is the ciliary body, followed by the scleral spur, trabecular meshwork, and lastly Schwalbe's line, which is the most anterior. A grade of 4 is assigned if the ciliary body is visible, and is considered safe for dilation. When the scleral spur is the most posterior structure visible, the angle is graded as a 3 and is safe to dilate. When 1/2 to 1/3 of the trabecular meshwork is visible, the angle is classified as a 2 and is somewhat risky to dilate. When only the most anterior portion or only Schwalbe's line is viewed, the angle is graded as a 1 and is considered to be at high risk for angle occlusion. If no structures are seen, then the angle is classified as 0 and the angle is closed."

      "explanation": "Various anatomical predisposing factors pose an increased risk for an episode of angle-closure. The two greatest factors are the depth of the anterior chamber and the morphology of the iris insertion. On average, individuals who possess emmetropic, myopic, or purely astigmatic refractive errors have deeper anterior chamber depths when compared to individuals with hypermetropia. Eyes with smaller anterior chamber depths are more predisposed to a greater degree to incur irido-corneal contact and hence carry an increased possibility of angle-closure attack."

      "answers": [" Primary congenital glaucoma   "],
      "explanation": "Primary congenital glaucoma is the most commonly encountered form of infantile glaucoma. This condition is seen more frequently in males, and the majority of cases are sporadic in origin with no inheritance pattern. 75% of cases occur bilaterally and typically present before the child's first birthday. The condition is caused by an abnormality of the angle (either a flat iris insertion or a concave iris insertion) and is rarely linked with any systemic disorders. Characteristically, the patient's caregiver will note a triad of symptoms: photophobia, epiphora, and blepharospasm. Occasionally, the parents will note that the child's corneas appear cloudy due to corneal edema. Clinical findings include a unilateral or bilaterally enlarged globes and corneas (greater than 12mm), horizontal tears in Descemet's membrane (Haab's striae), a myopic refractive error, elevated IOPs, corneal edema, hypoplasia of the iris stroma, and cupping of the optic nerve. If the condition persists, the globe and its associated structures will stretch due to consistently elevated IOP, resulting in buphthalmos. &#10;&#10;Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy usually affects males in their 20s and typically presents as a unilateral, painless loss of vision. &#10;&#10;It is common for mothers of young infants to note that one eye (or both eyes) of her infant constantly tears in conjunction with the presence of mucopurulent discharge. This epiphora results from a blockage of the nasolacrimal passageway, caused by a membrane covering the valve of Hasner. The majority of blockages will self-resolve without intervention (80-90% of infants) within the first 12 months of life. &#10;&#10;Dacryocystitis refers to inflammation of the lacrimal sac, commonly caused by nasolacrimal duct obstruction or infection. Symptoms of dacryocystitis typically involve pain, redness, and swelling over the medial canthal aspect of the lower eyelid where the lacrimal sac resides., Commonly, patients will also complain of watery eyes or mucous that may extrude from the punctum upon digital pressure."

      "options": [" Increased coffee consumption   ", " Decreased homocysteine levels  ", " Warm weather with minimal sun exposure  ", " Habitation in the southern latitude  "],
      "answers": [" Increased coffee consumption   "],
      "explanation": "Pseudoexfoliation/exfoliative glaucoma appears as white, flaky material that deposits along the pupillary margin, the anterior surface of the lens and other structures of the anterior chamber. The material is composed of extracellular matrix produced by ocular tissue along with other components of the body (such as the skin) and is therefore considered a systemic condition. Pseudoexfoliation is usually unilateral and is frequently seen in the elderly with a concurrent cataract. Transillumination defects, if present, are limited to the iris sphincter region. The pseudoexfoliative material can accumulate in the trabecular meshwork, causing an increase in IOP, leading to glaucoma. Studies have demonstrated that this condition is linked with high systemic levels of homocysteine. There is also evidence that high levels of coffee drinking (but not other caffeinated beverages) may increase the risk of developing exfoliative glaucoma. Roughly 99% of patients with this condition also possess the lysyl oxidase-like 1 (LOXL 1) gene; however, around 75% of the population without exfoliative glaucoma also has the LOXL 1 gene. It is therefore theorized that the gene is likely triggered by something environmental in nature. Research has demonstrated that living in the northern latitude along with high UV exposure and cooler temperatures may increase the chances of LOXL 1 gene activation. &#10;&#10;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22918628"

      "explanation": "The precise role and receptors specificity of adrenergic mechanisms in regulating the rate of aqueous humor formation are unclear. Studies using fluorophotometry have shown that beta adrenergic antagonists unequivocally decrease aqueous humor formation, particularly aqueous humor production during sleeping hours, during which production is decreased by up to 50%. This decrease is due to the B-arrestin/cAMP cascade regulation from the beta-adrenergic receptors. This does not mean that the intraocular pressure necessarily decreases at night; in fact, nocturnal intraocular pressure spikes have recently been reported; these may have a role in causing progressive glaucomatous damage."

      "explanation": "A nevus of Ota (also called oculodermal melanosis or oculodermal melanocytosis) is a congenital condition in which there is increased pigmentation of the periorbital skin as well as the uveal tract, generally unilaterally. This condition appears as purple/gray patches of melanocyte distribution and is usually seen in African-Americans and Asians but rarely in Caucasians. If a nevus of Ota is observed in a Caucasian, monitor carefully for malignancy. Due to the fact that this disorder is caused by increased levels of pigmentation, these cells can impede the flow of aqueous through the trabecular meshwork, potentially resulting in glaucoma."

      "explanation": "Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) is associated with a decrease in both brain derived and target derived growth factors of the eye. Optic nerve crush is a popular model used in experimental models of glaucoma, however, it does not completely simulate the pathogenesis of human glaucoma. Unlike human glaucoma, the death of ganglion cells is rapid when the optic nerve is crushed. There is a blood flow dysregulation that is known to occur in patients with glaucoma, and there is also a decrease in the number of superficial capillaries, however larger arteries and arterial flow remain intact. Nitric oxide secreted by endothelial cells helps in auto-regulation and increases the blood flow in the retina by metabolic processes, but it is toxic in larger amounts and disrupts the mitochondrial and DNA functions."

False negatives may occur due to lack of attention (the patient fell asleep). &#10;&#10;False positives occur when the patient responds without an accompanying light stimulus. A 'trigger-happy' patient would demonstrate a high amount of false positives. &#10;&#10;Nuclear sclerosis of the lens may cause generalized depression of the visual field.

      "answers": [" High hyperopia   "],
      "explanation": "The following factors represent an increased risk for the development of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) in patients with ocular hypertension: &#10;- Older age: POAG is more often associated with older-aged patients. &#10;- Enlarged vertical cup-to-disc ratio: Naturally, the horizontal cup-to-disc ratio is larger than the vertical cup-to-disc ratio (inferior and superior nerve tissue is usually thicker than the nasal and temporal tissue); however, when the vertical cup-to-disc ratio is enlarged, the area of visible disc surrounding the cup does not follow the ISNT rule, typically representing early glaucomatous damage. &#10;- Thin central corneal thickness: Eyes with a thinner central corneal thickness will give a false low reading on tonometry; therefore, the true eye pressure may be significantly higher than measured with the Goldmann tonometer. &#10;- Peripapillary atrophy: Peripapillary changes can be observed in over 50% of patients with ocular hypertension that convert to POAG. &#10;&#10;Additional risk factors for the conversion of ocular hypertension to POAG include elevated intraocular pressure, family history of glaucoma, and high myopia.

      "answers": [" Para-central scotoma   "],
      "explanation": "Characteristic defects in glaucoma consist of damage to the optic nerve head, resulting in a retinal nerve fiber bundle defect. The configuration of nerve fibers served by the damaged bundle will correspond to a specific defect in the visual field. The earliest visual field changes that may suggest glaucomatous damage commonly consist of an increased variability of responses in an area that will eventually develop a defect. &#10;&#10;When a glaucomatous visual field defect does occur, it tends to initially present as a paracentral scotoma. Paracentral scotomas are typically small and relatively steep depressions that are most commonly observed just supero-nasal to the fovea. Approximately 70% of all early glaucomatous field defects can be characterized as a paracentral scotoma. This type of defect is due to damage of the papillomacular bundle which will respect the horizontal midline. &#10;&#10;It is important to remember that a single visual field test cannot definitively prove that a visual field defect exists. For this reason, interpretation of visual fields should not be performed in isolation, but rather in conjunction with other clinical findings (IOP, appearance of optic nerve, RNFL). According to Kanski's Clinical Ophthalmology, there is a set of minimal criteria for determining glaucomatous damage (also known as Anderson's criteria), which is summarized below: &#10;&#10;1. Glaucoma hemifield test that is 'outside normal limits' on at least 2 consecutive occasions. &#10;2. A cluster of 3 or more non-edge points in a location typical for glaucoma, all of which are depressed on pattern standard deviation (PSD) at a P < 5% level and one of which is depressed at a P <1% level, on 2 consecutive occasions. &#10;3. Corrected pattern standard deviation (CPSD) that occurs in less than 5% of normal individuals on two consecutive fields."

      "question": "A 22-year old male presents in your office for his annual exam. Biomicroscopy reveals bilateral Krukenberg spindles and iris transillumination defects. Given the above findings, what is the correct diagnosis for this patient?",
      "options": [" Pigmentary dispersion syndrome   ", " Posner-Schlossman syndrome  ", " Salzmann's nodular degeneration  ", " Pseudoexfoliation  "],
      "answers": [" Pigmentary dispersion syndrome   "],
      "explanation": "Pigmentary dispersion syndrome generally occurs in young, myopic males with deep anterior chambers. This condition is caused by a disruption of the posterior iris pigment epithelium, causing this layer to rub against the ciliary zonules and release pigment into the anterior chamber and its associated structures. The aqueous in the anterior chamber displays convection currents. Warming inferiorly, aqueous rises and migrates forward towards the posterior surface of the endothelium, carrying pigment granules with it, then falls as it cools, causing the pigment to deposit vertically in a linear-fashion on the endothelium. Monitor these patients for blockage of the trabecular meshwork causing a rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) and potential glaucomatous damage to the optic nerve. Physical exertion as well as mydriasis may exacerbate pigment release; therefore, when dilating (especially with phenylephrine), you must be sure to measure post-dilated IOPs. &#10;&#10;Salzmann's nodular degeneration appears as blue/white hyaline plaque deposits between the epithelium and Bowman's membrane, generally around the pupillary area of the cornea. This condition stems from other pathologies, primarily old phlyctenula. Treatment is generally not required unless vision is affected. &#10;&#10;Posner-Schlossman syndrome causes an acute IOP spike, usually unilaterally and lasting for hours to weeks with recurrent episodes. Patients are often young and report decreased vision due to corneal edema, mild pain, and ocular redness. This syndrome is also known as glaucomatocyclitic crisis. Biomicroscopy will often reveal ciliary flush, a sluggish or dilated pupil, a mild anterior chamber reaction, potentially with keratic precipitates, corneal edema, open angles and normal optic nerves. IOP readings will normally range from 40-60 mmHg. The etiology is still uncertain; some have postulated that it may be of viral origin. Treatment includes (unless contraindicated) topical steroid drops, beta-blockers, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. &#10;&#10;Pseudoexfoliation appears as white, flaky material that deposits along the pupillary margin, the anterior surface of the lens and other structures of the anterior chamber. This condition is usually unilateral and is seen in the elderly with a concurrent cataract. Transillumination defects, if present, are limited to the iris sphincter region. The pseudoexfoliative material can accumulate in the trabecular meshwork, causing an increase in IOP leading to glaucoma."

If the probe is a certain size (specifically if it has a diameter of 3.06 mm), then theoretically the force from the surface tension of the tear film should cancel the spring force of the cornea.

      "answers": [" Plateau iris syndrome   "],
      "explanation": "Plateau iris syndrome is caused by an anteriorly positioned ciliary body, which results in displacement of the peripheral iris forward. The plateau configuration causes narrowing of the angle and can lead to mechanical obstruction of the trabecular meshwork, even though the anterior chamber will appear deep on slit lamp examination. Although an element of pupillary block is usually present in these cases, patients with plateau iris configuration will still show an occludable angle on gonioscopy, even in the presence of a patent peripheral iridotomy. &#10;Treatment of plateau iris commonly involves performing argon laser peripheral iridoplasty (ALPI), in which peripheral iris burns cause the iris to shrink and pull away from the angle. This laser treatment is much more effective than a laser peripheral iridotomy in preventing or managing angle closure glaucoma."

      "options": [" Raynaud's phenomenon  ", " Stiles Crawford effect I  ", " Troxler effect   ", " Riddoch phenomenon  "],
      "answers": [" Troxler effect   "],
      "explanation": "The Troxler effect is noted when individuals stare at a central fixation point and the peripheral targets disappear. This is observed regularly by patients when performing perimetry. This phenomenon is particularly evident when observing low contrast dull targets. Raynaud's phenomenon refers to an abnormal response of peripheral vasculature when an individual moves from a hot to a cold environment. This condition is caused by restriction of blood flow to the extremities, such as the fingers and toes, causing numbness or an excessively cool sensation when exposed to decreased temperatures or stress. The Riddoch phenomenon refers to the fact that a stimulus is only observed when it is in motion, and cannot be detected by the observer when it is static. The Riddoch phenomenon may be reported by individuals who suffer from an occipital lobe lesion, optic nerve damage, or chiasmal damage. The Stiles Crawford effect I refers to the fact that photoreceptors are more sensitive to light rays from the center of the pupil than to light rays entering from the periphery."

      "answers": [" Lying down to sleep   "],
      "explanation": "Intermittent angle-closure attacks are most likely to resolve spontaneously when a patient is laying down to sleep due to pupil constriction. Situations that cause pupil mydriasis (such as dimly-illuminated environments) can cause or exacerbate angle-closure. Acute-angle closure glaucoma is typically a unilateral phenomenon and is frequently attributable to pupillary block or plateau iris syndrome. Patients with this condition will often present with blurred vision, corneal edema, and ocular pain along with conjunctival injection, a frontal headache, a fixed and dilated pupil, a shallow anterior chamber, nausea and vomiting, and an elevated intraocular pressure."

Due to the ability of magno cells to respond to high temporal frequencies as well as the fact that the cells respond nonlinearly, the integrity of this pathway is able to be tested via a technique that is based upon frequency doubling. Research has demonstrated deficient frequency doubling in people displaying early stages of primary open angle glaucoma."

      "answers": [" Cyclocryoablation   "],
      "explanation": "Cilio-destructive procedures include cyclophotoablation (laser) or cyclocryoablation (freezing). These processes involve intentional damage to the ciliary processes, which decreases their production of aqueous. These are typically reserved as last resort procedures as they can lead to chronic hypotony as well as inflammation. The majority of clinicians will perform these procedures if the glaucoma is end-stage or complex such as in cases of neovascular glaucoma. However, given recent research and advancements in technological techniques, some surgeons are reconsidering their use of this procedure and are performing it on patients with less advanced glaucoma rather than reserving it as a last resort option. &#10;&#10;A trabeculoplasty is a glaucoma surgical procedure in which a laser beam is utilized to apply burns to areas of the trabecular meshwork with the goal of increasing fluid outflow and decreasing intraocular pressure. There are two types of laser trabeculoplasty procedures that are commonly used: argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) and selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT). SLT is newer technology than ALT and uses a Nd:YAG laser to specifically target melanocytes within the trabeculum. This provides an effective option for treatment with less thermal damage than ALT. Additionally, unlike ALT, SLT does not affect the overall structure of the trabecular meshwork, allowing for retreatment with SLT if necessary. &#10;&#10;Tube-shunt implantation and trabeculectomy are classified as filtering procedures. Both are considered by the majority of clinicians as the gold standard of incisional procedures for glaucoma. These techniques are typically reserved for patients with moderate to advanced glaucoma who possess good central vision and do not respond adequately to topical therapeutic intervention. &#10;&#10;Color Atlas and Synopsis of Clinical Ophthalmology.

      "question": "Differences in the depth of the anterior chamber can be observed in patients presenting with varying forms of secondary glaucoma.

      "options": [" Shallow, deep, normal   ", " Normal, shallow, shallow  ", " Shallow, deep, deep  ", " Shallow, normal, deep  ", " Normal, deep, shallow  ", " Normal, normal, shallow  "],
      "answers": [" Shallow, deep, normal   "],
      "explanation": "Patients with primary angle closure are anatomically predisposed to an elevation in intraocular pressure that is secondary to the obstruction of aqueous outflow. This blockage of aqueous drainage is caused by occlusion of the trabecular meshwork by the peripheral iris. Classic ocular signs in these patients include short axial length, shallow anterior chamber, and narrow anterior chamber angles. &#10;&#10;Patients with pigmentary glaucoma have characteristically deep anterior chambers that result in the mechanical rubbing of the iris against the crystalline lens zonules, leading to the liberation of fine pigment granules into the anterior chamber. &#10;&#10;Plateau iris syndrome presents in the same way as an angle closure, with elevated intraocular pressures secondary to a blockage of the trabecular meshwork by the peripheral iris; however, the anterior chamber depth is normal, and the iris plane is flat, rather than bowed."

Sodium transport is the primary step in the production of aqueous humor because its transport sets up an osmotic gradient, and water follows the sodium ions.

      "answers": [" Infero-temporal quadrant   "],
      "explanation": "Optic disc hemorrhages occurring at the margin of the optic nerve are most commonly associated with normal tension glaucoma. These hemorrhages appear at the edge of the optic disc and typically extend onto the nerve fiber layer (called Drance hemorrhages). Additionally, they are most often found at the infero-temporal quadrant of the optic nerve head. It is thought that patients who exhibit progressive optic neuropathy with intraocular pressures (IOPs) consistently within the normal range are likely to have some form of vascular insufficiency or low systemic blood pressure, which can lead to a decrease in ocular perfusion pressure. It is for this reason that optic disc hemorrhages are more commonly observed in individuals exhibiting normal IOPs. When an optic disc hemorrhage is present, it is common to eventually manifest a visual field defect in the region corresponding to the location of the previous hemorrhage (often several months later)."

      "explanation": "In addition to active secretion of aqueous humor by the non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells, aqueous humor is also produced by the passive processes of ultrafiltration and diffusion. These passive processes are dependent upon certain conditions, such as the level of capillary hydrostatic pressure, the oncotic pressure, and the level of the intraocular pressure. Fluid movement into the posterior chamber is favored by the hydrostatic pressure difference between the capillary pressure and the intraocular pressure. On the other hand, the oncotic pressure of the plasma and aqueous humor resists the movement of fluid into the posterior chamber. Passive secretion is thought to only play a minor role in the production of aqueous humor under normal conditions, as most of the formation of aqueous occurs as a result of active secretion."

      "explanation": "Aqueous humor is a carefully controlled filtrate of the blood that supplies nourishment to both the cornea and crystalline lens. It has a high turnover rate, as it is produced and removed continuously from the eye. If either the production of aqueous humor stops or there is a sudden pathological leaking of fluid, the globe becomes soft and loses its shape. Aqueous humor functions as a shock absorber and provides nutrition including glucose and oxygen to both the lens and cornea. &#10;&#10;The aqueous humor is an excellent source of antioxidants, particularly ascorbate, which may in part help in the removal of free radicals and thus the prevention of cataract formation. However, it does not supply oxygen via hemoglobin. Healthy eyes are devoid of both red blood cells and hemoglobin due to the blood aqueous-barrier; this serves to maintain excellent light transmissibility."

        " The patient lost fixation while undergoing imaging   ",
        " The patient likely has vessel attenuation caused by uncontrolled hypertension  ",

        " The patient blinked excessively during scan acquisition  "
      ],
      "answers": [" The patient lost fixation while undergoing imaging   "],
      "explanation": "Eye movements or loss of fixation by the patient while undergoing an OCT scan may be seen as a 'broken' or disjointed blood vessel. Typically, the newer OCT software is able to adjust for small fixation losses without compromising the quality of the scan; however, sometimes it may be necessary to repeat acquisition of the scan. Excessive blinking may lead to an inability to obtain adequate scans of the retina and will appear as black bands on the printout. If the patient suffers from a ptosis, again this area of the scan will be devoid of information and will appear black."

      "answers": [" The total deviation plot   "],
      "explanation": "Ptosis and cataracts will most likely present on this area of the printout (see figure 1A). &#10;&#10;The pattern deviation plot gives a more accurate rendering of whether or not a true defect exists by removing excess 'noise' such as that seen with a cataract. By removing the effects of generalized depression, it is easier to determine the size, shape and depth of a visual field defect (see figure 1B). &#10;&#10;The VFI relates information pertaining to the overall amount of field loss. The VFI ranges from 100% (normal) to 0% (a blind eye). This index is purported to be less affected by cataracts than the other indices. The VFI can be used to monitor progression when compared to previous visual field results. &#10;&#10;The glaucoma hemifield test compares test points above the horizontal midline to those below the midline. Any asymmetry is considered suspect and appropriate action should be taken (see figure 1C). &#10;&#10;Cataracts, if they are advanced enough, may cause a generalized depression of the visual field because they will act like a filter and will also scatter light. &#10;&#10;http://www.revoptom.com/content/c/39563/&#10;"

      "question": "When performing Van Herick angle estimation of your patient's temporal limbus with the slit lamp, how will placing the lighthouse temporally 40 degrees from the oculars affect the evaluation of the angle estimation?",

      "answers": [" The width of the angle will be underestimated   "],
      "explanation": "The Van Herick method of angle estimation, although not infallible, is a good way of assessing the probability of angle closure with dilation. The temporal angle of a patient is evaluated by having the patient look straight ahead, placing the oculars of the slit lamp in the straight ahead position and shifting the lighthouse temporally so that an angle of 60 degrees is created. The beam is then narrowed to an optic section and placed at the temporal limbus. The width of the anterior chamber space at the angle is then compared to the width of the corneal optic section. The procedure is repeated and the illumination source is placed nasally to assess the grade of the nasal angle. If the angle space is equal to 1/2 or greater than the corneal optic section, the angle is not considered occludable and is given a grade of 4. A grade 3 displays an angle space that is less than 1/2 but greater than 1/4 of the width of the corneal optic section, and is considered safe to dilate. A grade 2 has an angle space that is roughly equal to 1/4 the width of the corneal optic section, and may be dilated but with caution. A grade 1 has an angle space of less than 1/4 the width of the corneal optic section, and requires gonioscopy to ensure that the patient is safe to dilate. &#10;&#10;Placing the lighthouse so that an angle significantly greater than 60 degrees is created will cause an overestimation of the angle, while an angle much less than 60 degrees will cause underestimation of the angle. &#10;&#10;Reference: Casser, L., Fingeret, M., Woodcome, T.

      "answers": [" Timolol maleate 0.5%   "],
      "explanation": "Timolol maleate blocks both beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptors and serves to decrease intraocular pressure. The effects of timolol ophthalmic solution may be observed as early as one half hour after drop instillation, reaching peak efficiency at one- to two-hours post-instillation. &#10;&#10;Brimonidine tartrate is an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist causing increased uveoscleral outflow and decreased aqueous production. Topical ocular administration results in peak IOP reduction levels two hours after instillation. &#10;&#10;Latanoprost is a prostaglandin analog and decreases intraocular pressure (IOP) by increasing uveoscleral outflow. Its effects reach peak effectiveness roughly two hours after use. &#10;&#10;Bimatoprost is also a prostaglandin analog and causes IOP reduction via increasing both uveoscleral and trabecular meshwork outflow. Its effects can be observed four hours after instillation, reaching peak effectiveness at eight to twelve hours after instillation. &#10;&#10;References: &#10;https://www.apotex.com/us/en/products/downloads/bio/timo_opso_be.pdf. &#10;http://www.alphaganp.com/alphganp.pdf. &#10;http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/020597s044lbl.pdf. &#10;http://www.allergan.com/assets/pdf/lumigan_pi.pdf."

      "options": [" Timoptic?   ", " Alphagan-P?  ", " Lumigan?  ", " Cosopt?  "],
      "answers": [" Timoptic?   "],
      "explanation": "Studies have demonstrated that aqueous production decreases at night due to decreased adrenergic stimulation. Due to the fact that Timoptic? largely functions by reducing aqueous production by decreasing the concentration of cyclic andenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the ciliary epithelium, this medication is not as effective at stabilizing a nocturnal spike in IOP. However, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors remain effective at decreasing aqueous production nocturnally because the carbonic anhydrase component of the system that controls aqueous production at night remains active. Interference or inhibition of this component of the system will therefore lead to decreased IOP. Although Alphagan-P? also serves to decrease aqueous production, studies have shown that it does remain effective at night (likely due to its role in increasing uveoscleral outflow). Prostaglandin analogs such as Lumingan? maintain good control of IOP both diurnally and nocturnally and significantly decrease the risk of an IOP spike. &#10;&#10;References: &#10;http://www.revoptom.com/content/c/27571/ &#10;Pearls in Glaucoma Therapy.

      "question": "Which of the following surgical glaucoma treatments involves the application of laser burns to the trabeculum in order to enhance aqueous outflow and subsequently lower intraocular pressure?",
      "options": [" Trabeculotomy  ", " Iridotomy  ", " Trabeculectomy  ", " Iridectomy  ", " Trabeculoplasty   "],
      "answers": [" Trabeculoplasty   "],
      "explanation": "A trabeculoplasty is a glaucoma surgical procedure in which a laser beam is utilized to apply burns to areas of the trabecular meshwork with the goal of increasing fluid outflow and decreasing intraocular pressure. There are two types of laser trabeculoplasty procedures that are commonly used: argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) and selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT). SLT is newer technology than ALT and uses a Nd:YAG laser to specifically target melanocytes within the trabeculum. This provides an effective option for treatment with less thermal damage than ALT. Additionally, unlike ALT, SLT does not affect the overall structure of the trabecular meshwork, allowing for retreatment with SLT if necessary. &#10;&#10;A trabeculectomy is glaucoma procedure that involves creating a fistula between the angle of the anterior chamber and sub-Tenon's space. This allows for a secondary route for drainage of the aqueous, which is allowed to flow directly from the anterior chamber into a 'drainage bleb,' bypassing the trabeculum. &#10;&#10;Trabeculotomy surgery is traditionally performed in cases of congenital glaucoma and involves surgically dissecting the trabeculum to create a more direct opening for aqueous to flow into Schlemm's canal. The anterior chamber angle is accessed via the external surface of the eye; therefore, the need for a clear cornea is unnecessary. &#10;&#10;An iridotomy involves creating an opening in the tissue of the iris (usually with a YAG laser). An iridectomy involves the intraocular removal of iris tissue (usually from the far periphery)."

        " No, the patient will never be able to undergo dilation even with a peripheral laser iridotomy  "
      ],
      "answers": [" Yes, the patient is absolutely safe to dilate   "],
      "explanation": "According to the Becker-Shaffer grading system, the ability to safely dilate a patient is determined by which ocular structure is visible most posteriorly. The anatomy of the angle of the anterior chamber is comprised of several structures. The most posterior of the structures is the ciliary body, followed by the scleral spur, trabecular meshwork, and lastly Schwalbe's line, which is the most anterior. A grade of 4 is assigned if the ciliary body is visible, and is considered safe for dilation. When the scleral spur is the most posterior structure visible the angle is graded as a 3 and is safe to dilate. When 1/2 to 1/3 of the trabecular meshwork is visible, the angle is classified as a 2 and is somewhat risky to dilate. When only the most anterior portion or only Schwalbe's line is viewed, the angle is graded as a 1 and is considered to be at high risk for angle occlusion. If no structures are seen, then the angle is classified as 0 and the angle is closed.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Gonioscopy"

      "explanation": "Patients with active inflammation of the anterior chamber should not undergo YAG capsulotomy. Because a YAG capsulotomy creates a potential conduit between the anterior and posterior pole, any inflammation present in the anterior chamber may increase the chances of posterior pole inflammation. If the patient presents with an active anterior chamber inflammation, the procedure should be delayed until the inflammation has subsided. &#10;&#10;Patients with SPK secondary to dry eyes or a large choroidal nevus can undergo YAG capsulotomy, as can those with controlled glaucoma.

Anterior chamber lens implants are generally used if the posterior capsule breaks or there is some other reason that a PCIOL cannot be used. Iris-fixed are rarely used anymore. A characteristic finding with these lenses is that this implant induces a square pupil.

      "options": [" 10x  ", " 20x  ", " 8x  ", " 4x  ", " 16x  "],
      "answers": [" 4x  "],
      "explanation": "In order to determine the magnification needed for a patient to be able to see a particular object, one requires the measurement of the patient's entering acuity and the acuity of the goal they desire to see. &#10;For example, the above patient's entering visual acuity is 20/400, and his goal acuity is 20/100. Once these two values are known, the entering acuity is then divided by the goal acuity, with the result being the needed angular magnification. Again, for the above patient: 400/100 = 4. Therefore, he would require a telescope with at least 4x magnification to see the scoreboard."

      "answers": [" Anton's syndrome   "],
      "explanation": "Patients with cortical blindness can often be unaware of their visual deficit. This denial of blindness is known as Anton's syndrome, or visual anosognosia. In these cases, patients will act as if their vision is unaffected. They tend to run into walls, bump into objects, and walk around without the precautions that a blind person would take. When confronted about their vision loss and behavior, patients will make excuses such as 'the lighting is poor' or 'these glasses must be an old prescription.' This syndrome mostly occurs in patients with blindness due to occipital lobe disease, but it may also occur subsequent to cataracts, retinopathies, and optic nerve disease. The explanation of the mechanism and anatomy responsible for Anton's syndrome is widely unknown and unclear. Typically, after several weeks or months, patients eventually become aware of their visual deficits. &#10;&#10;Blindsight is the opposite of visual anosognosia. These patients have some visual function but are unaware of it and deny its existence. They lack awareness of visual stimuli, but respond to it. &#10;&#10;Charles Bonnet syndrome occurs in patients with severe vision loss who experience hallucinatory images. These patients are completely aware the objects that they are seeing are not real, and there is no history of mental disorder."

      "explanation": "The ETDRS chart is a logarithmic eye chart modeled after the Bailey-Lovie chart. It is the primary standardized eye chart used in evaluating the visual acuity of low vision patients. The ETDRS charts are logMAR (log of the minimum angle of resolution) in design and are constructed with 10 Sloan sans serif letters. Each line is 1.26 times larger than the line below, and the construction of each line is such that the difficulty is theoretically equivalent on every line. &#10;&#10;The construction of the ETDRS chart is made to eliminate the inherent errors in the measurement of visual acuity found in the traditional non-standardized Snellen test charts. The Snellen test charts have variations in legibility of different letters as well as differences in the spacing between the lines of letters and between adjacent letters on single lines. The ETDRS logarithmic chart is constructed in such a way that each line of letters is 0.1 log units (about 1.26 times) larger than the previous line. This is a geometric progression."

      "answers": [" Increased by 9 times the original brightness   "],
      "explanation": "It has been said that prescribed optical devices without consideration of the appropriate lighting will often doom the patient to failure. Unfortunately, there are no good tests to determine the exact type of lighting. Generally, different light levels are tried during the examination (as well as during the training session) with the patient using an adjustable light. The distance from the page is very important because of the inverse-square law of illumination: the intensity varies inversely as the square of the distance from the page. If the light is moved from 1 foot to 3 feet from the page, a bulb will be needed that is approximately nine times as bright to keep the same illumination on the page. (It should be noted that technically, this relationship is only true for a point source of light.) Clinically, however, it gives a good approximation of the change in brightness (illumination) seen on the page when the distance of the light is changed. The illumination in the above example would therefore increase by 9X when the bulb is moved towards the page."

Macular scarring is likely to result in a central scotoma, depending upon the extent of the scarring, but the peripheral portion of the field should remain unaffected. A patient who has tilted discs will have an optic nerve that exits the eye superiorly and may be accompanied by situs inversus, fundus ectasia, myopia, and superior temporal visual field defects. Drusen of the optic nerve head may present with vertical elongation of the blind spot, and occasionally peripheral constriction of the visual field or arcuate defects, making it sometimes difficult to discern from glaucomatous damage. Other causes of generalized depression include but are not limited to: fatigue, small pupils, advanced age, and media opacities. &#10;&#10;References: Susanna, R. and Medeiros, F.

      "question": "Congenital cataracts can be caused by a viral infection of the mother with rubella virus (German measles) during development of the primary lens fibers. At which time period in embryonic development can infection cause congenital cataracts?",
      "options": [" 3rd trimester  ", " 2nd trimester  ", " Conception  ", " Post-delivery  ", " 1st trimester   "],
      "answers": [" 1st trimester   "],
      "explanation": "The developing lens is susceptible to rubella virus when the lens fibers are forming, which occurs around weeks 4-7 of gestation. Earlier infection will occur prior to lens fiber development, and the lens is resistant to later infection because the virus is unable to penetrate the lens capsule. &#10;&#10;The fetus is most susceptible to lenticular damage during the first trimester. Contraction of the rubella virus will cause the greatest amount of damage during this time period. Congenital cataracts are usually detectable at birth but may be seen later because the virus can persist in the lens. &#10;&#10;Ref: Remington, LA. Clinical Anatomy of the Visual System, 1998 pp 109"

      "options": [" Actinobacteria  ", " Nematode  ", " Lentivirus  ", " Parasite  ", " Spirochete   ", " Mycobacteria  "],
      "answers": [" Spirochete   "],
      "explanation": "The causative organism of syphilis is a spirochete known as Treponema pallidum. Spirochetes have a unique structure that is responsible for their motility. This distinctive configuration consists of a central protoplasmic cylinder, bound by a plasma membrane, cell wall, and an outer sheath composed of glycosaminoglycans. Between the cell wall and outer sheath are multiple periplasmic flagella. These flagella span the entire length of the cell and are anchored at both ends. It is believed that the flagella rotate and cause the organism to propel forward in a corkscrew-like manner. Spirochetes can easily move through viscous solutions with little impediment, which explains their ability to easily penetrate and invade host tissue. &#10;&#10;Gonorrhea, chlamydia, and tuberculosis are all infections caused by bacteria. The causative organism of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a lentivirus; toxoplasmosis is caused by a parasite, and toxocariasis is caused by a nematode."

      "options": [" Budding  ", " Conjugation   ", " Binary fission  ", " Transformation  "],
      "answers": [" Conjugation   "],
      "explanation": "Conjugation occurs between a donor (possesses a conjugative plasmid) and recipient bacteria. The donor bacterium initiates contact with the recipient via a sex pilus, allowing for cell-to-cell contact and transfer of DNA. The plasmids often contain genes that encode for toxin production, virulence factors, and antibiotic resistance. Genetic transformation is achieved by very few strains of bacteria and may only occur during certain phases of growth; therefore, rapid antibiotic resistance is not feasible. Budding and binary fission are means of reproduction but are not directly responsible for antibacterial resistance. Genes must have been transferred that code for resistance prior to budding and binary fission in order for the progeny to contain genes that allow for drug resistance."

      "answers": [" Helicobacter pylori   "],
      "explanation": "H. pylori is a helix-shaped gram-negative microaerophillic organism that colonizes in cells that secrete the mucosal lining of the stomach. These bacteria protect themselves from stomach acid by secreting urease, which, through a series of reactions, helps to neutralize the lower pH levels. H. pylori causes chronic gastritis, which in turn can lead to ulcer formation if pepsin and stomach acid levels increase to the point that the protective mucosal lining is broken down. C. tetani is associated with the contraction of tetanus. V. cholerae causes cholera, resulting in abdominal cramps, diarrhea, fever, and vomiting."

The catalase test is performed by applying a drop of hydrogen peroxide to a microscope slide. A colony of bacteria is then exposed to the hydrogen peroxide via an applicator stick. The presence of bubbles or froth yields a positive catalase test. Staphylococci and Micrococci are catalase-positive organisms.

      "options": [" Chemotaxis   ", " Phagocytosis  ", " Apoptosis  ", " Transposition  "],
      "answers": [" Chemotaxis   "],
      "explanation": "Many bacteria possess flagella, or thread-like appendages, which allow for movement. Certain chemicals attract bacteria (chemoattractants), while others repel them (chemorepellents). Chemotaxis refers to the response of the bacteria to either chemoattractants or chemorepellents. In the absence of either of the aforementioned chemicals, bacteria will move in random patterns. Some bacteria possess genes and proteins which allow for the sensing of concentration gradients in their environment. In the presence of a chemoattractant, bacteria will have longer runs in the appropriate direction. &#10;&#10;Apoptosis is defined as programmed cell death. &#10;&#10;Phagocytosis refers to the engulfment of a particle (for example, bacteria) by a phagocyte (for example, a macrophage). &#10;&#10;Transposition refers to the rare phenomenon in which genes move from one place on the genome to another position."

      "options": [" Complex   ", " Icosahedral  ", " Helical  ", " Enveloped  "],
      "answers": [" Complex   "],
      "explanation": "Viruses are highly variable in their sizes and shapes. There are essentially five (or four if you consider 'enveloped' a class of its own) general classifications of structures: naked helical, enveloped helical, naked icosahedral, enveloped icosahedral and complex. Helically-shaped virions appear like a tightly-coiled ribbon that can form a rod or can resemble a telephone cord. An example of one such virus is the tobacco mosaic virus. Icosahedral appears as a polyhedron, with 20 equilateral triangular faces and 12 vertices. Each point of the different triangles is joined together, forming a capsomere, which can either be 5- or 6- sided. The adenovirus is an example of an icosahedral structure. Complex viruses appear neither icosahedral nor helical and tend to comprise tails or complex outer walls. Viruses are further classified based upon the nucleic acid genome. Viruses contain DNA or RNA that may be single-stranded or double-stranded, linear or circular, segmented or not. Classification also depends on whether or not the viral RNA can function as messenger RNA."

      "answers": [" Borrelia burgdorferi   "],
      "explanation": "Borrelia burgdorferi is a Gram-negative spirochete that is transmitted via mice and deer ticks. A person or child affected by Lyme disease may experience fatigue, headaches, and fevers. A definitive diagnostic sign is a red rash with a bull's eye appearance around the site of infection called erythema migrans occurring three to thirty days post-bite. Yersinia pestis is a gram-negative rod responsible for causing the plague. Legionella pneumophila is a Gram-negative bacterium and is the culprit that causes Legionnaire's disease. This bacterium takes up residence in the lungs and causes high fevers, headaches, and severe bronchopneumonia among other problems. Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a Gram-positive rod normally found in very overcrowded living conditions. This pathogen can lead to kidney, cardiac, and nervous tissue destruction."

      "answers": [" Rickettsia   "],
      "explanation": "Rickettsia is a Gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium. Rickettsia is found on ticks, fleas, and lice and can cause many diseases in humans including typhus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and rickettsial pox. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is caused by tick bites. Symptoms include chills, fever, rash, headache, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, and confusion. The prognosis is good with treatment. Rarely, complications can lead to hearing loss, paralysis, brain damage, lung failure, kidney failure, nerve damage, and death. Treatment includes careful removal of the tick along with tetracycline or doxycycline. &#10;&#10;Mycoplasma is a genus of bacteria that lack a cell wall and are capable of causing atypical pneumonia. Corynebacterium is associated with diphtheria. Cryptococcus neoformans is a type of fungus that causes cryptococcosis which is an infection that involves the central nervous system and the lungs."

      "options": [" Cutaneous   ", " Opportunistic  ", " Subcutaneous  ", " Systemic  ", " Superficial  "],
      "answers": [" Cutaneous   "],
      "explanation": "Human fungal infections can be categorized based upon the site of invasion and the degree of infection. Cutaneous infections are limited to deeper layers of the skin, hair and nails. Examples of offending pathogens are epidermophyton and microsporum, which can lead to tinea, ring worm, jock itch, and athlete's foot. Cutaneous infections are usually treated with topical ointments (for instance, Monistat-Derm® (miconazole)). Superficial infections do not extend deeper than the outermost layers of the skin, hair, and nails and are often seen in tropical regions. A common superficial infection is that caused by Tinea versicolor, which results in the appearance of spots on the back, chest, arms and legs. Superficial infections are commonly resolved through the use of cleansing agents. Subcutaneous infections involve deep tissue and result from the introduction of fungi through a piercing wound. These types of infections tend to be chronic in nature and can prove to be difficult to treat. An example of a subcutaneous infection is Sporotrichosis which is caused by Sporothrix schenckii. Remedies include amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, or surgical excision. Systemic infections generally originate in the lungs due to inhalation of spores of dimorphic fungi. Common examples are histoplasmosis and valley fever (coccidioides). Opportunistic fungal infections are seen in individuals who are immunocompromised. These types of infections tend to be very serious and can be fatal. Examples of opportunistic infections include aspergillosis, candidiasis (thrush), and Pneumocystis pneumonia."

        " Allows for the determination of which type of media promotes the proliferation of a specific bacteria  "
      ],
      "answers": [" Denotes the sensitivity of an organism to an antibiotic   "],
      "explanation": "An agar plate is inoculated with an isolated bacterium. Disks that are permeated with different antibiotics are placed in separate places on the agar plate. After the incubation period is over, the amount of bacteria that have grown on the plate is assessed. A clear ring surrounding a disk indicates that the bacteria are sensitive to this particular antibiotic and were unable to grow in its presence. A larger ring indicates a greater sensitivity to the antibiotic. The lack of a clear zone denotes that the bacteria are resistant to the antibiotic; therefore treatment of the bacteria with this particular antibiotic would be ineffective. PFU allows for the functional determination of the number of virus particles capable of cell damage. For this test, host cells are infected with a virus. The combination is plated on agar, and the number of plaques that form are counted. Plaques are localized areas of cell damage or cell lysis. Each plaque is thought to represent a single virion."

There are many ways in which a virus can infect a host cell. A non-enveloped virus can directly inject their DNA into host cells. Viruses with envelopes can fuse the host cell, leading to the incorporation of the envelope into the plasma membrane of the host, which then leaves the DNA free to transfer into the host cell. Viruses may also enter the host cell via endocytosis. After the process of endocytosis is complete, the virus sheds its envelope and releases its DNA into the host cell.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Osmosis"

The composition and complexity of glycocalyces varies from bacteria to bacteria. The presence of a glycocalyx generally infers an ability of the bacteria to cause infection. A very condensed glycocalyx that is tightly bound to the cell wall is termed a capsule. A loosely-adhering glycocalyx is called a slime layer. Both serve to defend the cell from desiccation as well as to protect it from phagocytosis."

      "options": [" Generalized transduction  ", " Conjugation  ", " Sexual reproduction   ", " Transformation  "],
      "answers": [" Sexual reproduction   "],
      "explanation": "Eukaryotic cells create new genomes via sexual reproduction. Prokaryotic cells use transformation, transduction, and conjugation as methods of creating new genomes. Transformation occurs when a cell uptakes naked DNA material secreted from live bacteria or released from dead bacteria. Transduction is the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another via a virus. The process begins with a virus destroying a host cell (bacterium 1) and incorporating some of its genes into the viral genome. The virus then replicates, and some of the progeny contain the original host DNA from bacterium 1. The progeny then infect another bacterium (bacterium 2), injecting some of the original host DNA (from bacterium 1), along with viral DNA, into bacterium 2. Conjugation occurs between a donor (possessing a conjugative plasmid) and recipient bacteria. The donor bacterium initiates contact with the recipient via a sex pilus, allowing for cell-to-cell contact and transfer of DNA.

Sabouraud's agar is unique in that it possesses a low pH that causes the inhibition of most bacterial growth, allowing for better isolation of the fungus. Hay infusion agar is frequently utilized to culture slime moulds. &#10;&#10;Cetrimide agar is designed to isolate Gram-negative bacteria. &#10;&#10;Blood agar plates are useful for the detection of pathogenic organisms via the presence of hemolytic activity (the ability of organisms to lyse or destroy red blood cells).

This process requires a great expenditure of energy. Heterotrophs, such as animals and fungi, cannot fix carbon dioxide as their sole carbon source; these organisms must obtain carbon from organic sources (most commonly other organisms). A prototroph is defined as an organism that is capable of synthesizing its own amino acids, vitamins, and other nutrients from inorganic compounds.

      "options": [" Klebsiella   ", " Salmonella  ", " Shigella  ", " Campylobacter  "],
      "answers": [" Klebsiella   "],
      "explanation": "Klebsiella is a Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium that can cause pneumonia, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Infections caused by this organism may approach high mortality rates (about 50%), even with treatment. All of the other mentioned microorganisms are common culprits of food poisoning. The most common symptoms of food poisoning are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, all of which serve to eliminate bacteria and contaminated food from the system."

      "answers": [" Golgi apparatus   "],
      "explanation": "The role of the Golgi apparatus is to serve as a final check point for proteins and lipids prior to transport to either intracellular or extracellular destinations. Lysozymes are responsible for digestion of nutrients, old cell parts, or foreign particles within the cell. Chromosomes are highly organized structures of coiled DNA and protein. Ribosomes play a major role in the synthesis of proteins."

      "answers": [" Minimum inhibitory concentration   "],
      "explanation": "The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the lowest concentration of a drug that visibly inhibits the further growth of a particular organism. It is determined by inoculating a series of tubes or plates with known antimicrobial concentrations. After a standard period of incubation, the concentration of the antimicrobial that inhibits growth of the organism is known as the MIC. &#10;&#10;The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) is the minimum concentration of a drug that actually kills the organism rather than just inhibiting further growth."

      "options": [" Molluscum contagiosum  ", " Scabies   ", " Tinea  ", " Impetigo  "],
      "answers": [" Scabies   "],
      "explanation": "Scabies is a skin condition that is caused by parasitic mites that burrow under the skin and cause itching, rashes, and blisters. The condition is spread via close contact with infected people or infected linens or towels. Patients typically report that the severity of the itching worsens at night. Scabies is treated via the application of prescribed topical cream or lotion or via oral medication. Although scabies will self-resolve, it is best to seek treatment immediately if the condition is suspected in order to minimize its chances of spreading. &#10;&#10;Molluscum contagiosum is a cutaneous viral infection that results in small red or skin-colored bumps. Lesions can be removed, or a topical ointment can be prescribed to decrease healing time. The condition, if left untreated, will self-resolve. &#10;&#10;Impetigo is bacterial in nature (caused by staphylococcus) and results in cutaneous blisters of various sizes. The lesions are frequently limited to the arms, legs, and face. &#10;&#10;Tinea, also known ringworm, is a fungal infection of the skin. The lesions associated with this condition appear circular with clear centers. Athlete's foot is a type of ringworm. &#10;&#10;References: &#10;http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/tc/scabies-treatment-overview &#10;http://medicalcenter.osu.edu/patientcare/healthcare_services/skin_conditions/skin_infections/viral_infections_skin/molluscum_contagiosum/Pages/index.aspx"

      "explanation": "Toxoplasma is a protozoan parasite. Protozoa are microscopic, single-celled, mobile organisms. Protozoa are classified into three phyla: Sarcomastigophora, apicomplexa and ciliophora. Helminths are worm-like multi-cellular parasites. Helminths are further categorized into nematodes (roundworms), cestodes (tapeworms), and trematodes (flukes). Schistosomes are a type of trematode."

      "answers": [" Non-enveloped viruses   "],
      "explanation": "The correct answer is non-enveloped viruses. Non-enveloped viruses are typically very resistant to environmental degradation and therefore survive longer in the environment and are harder to disinfect than enveloped viruses, such as the influenza virus. Whether a virus is a DNA or RNA virus has no effect on its environmental durability."

      "options": [" Obligate aerobe  ", " Facultative anaerobe   ", " Strict anaerobe  ", " Microaerophile  "],
      "answers": [" Facultative anaerobe   "],
      "explanation": "Facultative anaerobes are capable of using oxygen as a life source but can also thrive using anaerobic respiration. When culturing this type of bacteria in a test tube of liquid media, one would observe the bacteria dispersed throughout the entire tube but with greatest concentration at the top, as aerobic respiration yields a more favorable energy result. &#10;&#10;Obligate aerobes require oxygen to survive. Test tube culturing would display bacteria gathering at the top of the tube where the oxygen levels are greatest. &#10;&#10;Microaerophiles are capable of utilizing oxygen, but only at lower concentrations. A test tube culture of microaerophillic bacteria would result in the greatest concentration of bacteria towards the upper portion of the test tube, but not at the very top. &#10;&#10;Strict anaerobes cannot tolerate oxygen and rely on anaerobic respiration to survive. A test tube culture of strict anaerobes would display the greatest concentration of bacteria towards the bottom of the tube where the least amount of oxygen is present. &#10;&#10;Aerotolerant organisms are capable of growing in the presence of oxygen but do not actually utilize it for respiration. One would observe these bacteria evenly distributed throughout a test tube liquid culture."

      "question": "Blood agar is a suitable culture media for most bacterial and fungal samples except Neisseria, Haemophilus, and Moraxella species. If one of these organisms is suspected, which of the following media should be utilized for culturing purposes?",
      "options": [" Phenethyl alcohol agar  ", " Knop agar  ", " Chocolate agar   ", " Sabouraud's agar  ", " Malt extract agar  "],
      "answers": [" Chocolate agar   "],
      "explanation": "Chocolate agar is a variant of the blood agar plate that contains red blood cells that have been slowly heated to a temperature in which the blood cells are lysed (80 degrees Celsius). The agar is named after the color of the plate, and does not actually contain any form of chocolate. This type of agar is specifically used for growing fastidious organisms such as Neisseria, Haemophilus, and Moraxella species that do not grow well on conventional blood agar plates. &#10;&#10;Chocolate agar with the addition of bacitracin becomes selective for Haemophilus, while another variant of chocolate agar, known as Thayer-Martin agar, contains an assortment of different antibiotics that results in selection of Neisseria species. &#10;&#10;Sabouraud's agar and malt extract agar are fungal media. Knop agar is a type of moss media, and phenethyl alcohol agar selects for staphylococcal species while inhibiting Gram-negative bacilli."

      "question": "The immune system will produce antibodies in response to a pathogen. What portion of the bacterial cell causes an immune reaction and is responsible for the creation of antibodies by the host?",
      "options": [" Porin proteins  ", " Peptidoglycan  ", " Lipid A  ", " O side chains   "],
      "answers": [" O side chains   "],
      "explanation": "The outer portion of a gram-negative cellular envelope contains chains of lipopolysaccharides. These chains consist of lipid A, a core polysaccharide, and an O side chain. Lipid A is an endotoxin (which is a misnomer, as this component is actually located outside of the cell, but it produces the same results as an endotoxin) that causes symptoms associated with infections. The O side chain is also called an O antigen, which is specific to certain bacteria. The immune system will host a reaction to this antigen and produce antibodies in response in order to prohibit future infections. Some bacteria are capable of changing their O side chains to avoid detection by the immune system. Porin proteins are embedded within the matrix of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that allow for passage of nutrients needed by the cell. Peptidoglycan is a polymer that is located in the cellular walls of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but is seen to a much greater extent in the Gram-positive bacteria."

      "answers": [" Teichoic acids   "],
      "explanation": "Cell walls define the shape of the cell and serve as protection for the bacteria. Gram-negative cells have complex cellular envelopes comprised of only a thin layer of peptidoglycan sandwiched between an outer and inner membrane. The outer membrane contains porin proteins, within its matrix which allow for the passage of molecules (i.e., nutrients) into the cell. The outer membrane also includes lipopolysaccharides, which consist of an O side chain (antigen), a core polysaccharide, and lipid A (endotoxin). In contrast, the composition of a Gram-positive cell wall is relatively simple: it contains a thick layer of peptidoglycan, teichoic, and lipoteichoic acids. Gram-positive cells have only one plasma membrane."

      "explanation": "Eukaryotic cells are complex cells surrounded by a plasma membrane, which serves as the outer boundary of the cell. Eukaryotic cells possess membrane-bound organelles and contain a nucleus that is encapsulated by a nuclear envelope. Prokaryotic cells are classified as simple, single-celled organisms that do not possess a true nucleus; instead, these cells have a nucleoid region of structures that consist of RNA, DNA and protein. Prokaryotic cells multiply through binary fission."

      "answers": [" Clostridium botulinum   "],
      "explanation": "C. botulinum can be used to treat blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm. This type of bacteria produces a toxin that blocks nerve impulses to the muscles, causing paralysis or semi-paralysis. By controlling the amount and site of injection, it is possible to decrease or eliminate muscle spasms. The effect is transient, lasting an average of three to four months. Side effects include blurred vision, ptosis and diplopia, none of which are permanent. C. botulinum is also used for cosmetic purposes as Botox injections. The toxin is injected intramuscularly to reduce the signs of aging by eliminating fine lines on the skin."

      "explanation": "There is currently much debate in the literature regarding Pseudomonas because it was previously believed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa was capable of penetrating an intact cornea by secreting proteolytic enzymes that could break down the corneal barrier. However, current research suggests that this line of thinking no longer holds true. At present, it is believed that N. gonorrhoeae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria species, and Haemophilus species are capable of infecting an intact cornea.

      "answers": [" Staphylococcus aureus   "],
      "explanation": "Toxic shock syndrome is a potentially lethal infection caused by S. aureus. The infection is caused by the use of super-absorbent tampons which decreases the need for frequent replacement. The environment and the tampon contribute to a great breeding ground for this pathogen. &#10;&#10;C. trachomatis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) characterized by burning sensation during urination, penile or vaginal discharge, and, if left untreated, may cause infertility. People affected with chlamydia may also be completely asymptomatic. Gonorrhea is also an STD. Symptoms include those seen with chlamydia as well as fever, sore throat, increased urinary frequency, and other symptoms. If left untreated, long-term complications of gonorrhea include infertility, long-term joint pain, meningitis, and heart valve infection. People infected with gonorrhea must be reported to the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC). &#10;&#10;T. gondii is commonly associated with improper handling of raw meat or cat fecal matter from an animal that has ingested infected meat; however, it rarely leads to illness in healthy individuals. For this reason, it is important that pregnant mothers do not handle feline fecal matter so as not to potentially harm the unborn fetus, as toxoplasmosis can result in blindness if enough retinal damage occurs. Immunocompromised persons may suffer from encephalitis and chorioretinitis, among other problems."

      "options": [" Tularemia  ", " Candidiasis   ", " Psoriasis  ", " Actinic keratosis  "],
      "answers": [" Candidiasis   "],
      "explanation": "Candidiasis is a fungal infection. A number of species of the genus Candida are part of the normal flora that live on the skin and mucous membranes of humans without causing an associated infection. If something alters the body's immune system (such as a medication or illness) or results in an environment where the fungus can flourish, candidiasis symptoms may occur. A fungal infection of the throat or mouth caused by candida is called thrush. Candidiasis is treated by oral or topical anti-fungal medications. &#10;&#10;Patients with psoriasis possess patches of red, inflamed plaques of dermal tissue with overlying white, dry scales whose severity waxes and wanes and is caused by overly rapid replication of skin cells. &#10;&#10;Actinic keratosis is a precursor to squamous cell carcinoma and appears as scaly, dry skin that does not heal. People with skin of lighter pigmentation along with those with excessive exposure to ultraviolet light tend to be most at risk for development of this condition. &#10;&#10;Tularemia is an infection caused by the bacteria Francisella tularensis. Individuals may become infected via exposure with an infected animal (such as a rodent or rabbit), being bitten by a tick or deer fly, drinking contaminated water, or by exposure in the laboratory. Symptoms may include fever, an ulcer at the entry site of the organism, swollen lymph nodes, conjunctival injection, or swelling of the tissues of the throat (depending on how and where the organism entered the body). &#10;&#10;References: &#10;http://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candidiasis/ &#10;http://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/"

      "question": "When performing the swinging flashlight test to examine your patient's pupils, you observe a potential mild relative afferent pupillary defect (APD). Which of the following will help to enhance the detection of the APD?",
      "options": [" A 0.3 log neutral density filter   ", " A red lens  ", " Increase the overhead lighting by 5 lumens  ", " Change the light source to a MacBeth lamp  ", " Increase the brightness of the test light  "],
      "answers": [" A 0.3 log neutral density filter   "],
      "explanation": "If an APD is suspected, the placement of a 0.3 log neutral density filter over the suspected eye will result in enhancement of the APD. &#10;&#10;A MacBeth lamp is considered the best illumination under which to perform color vision testing. &#10;&#10;A red lens will not enhance the observation of a suspected relative afferent pupillary defect. &#10;&#10;Pupil size should be evaluated in both bright and dim illumination; however, increasing the overhead illumination will not increase the ability to observe an APD, as the swinging flashlight test should be performed in a semi-darkened room. Increasing the test light (trans-illuminator) will also prove detrimental to enhancing the observation of a mild APD. If the light stimulus is too bright, the pupils will remain constricted instead of re-dilating, resulting in minimal pupil movement and making it difficult to discern the presence of an APD. &#10;&#10;Reference: &#10;Ophthalmology 3rd edition.

      "question": "While performing confrontation fields, your patient reports seeing all of your fingers when presented on the left and right side of her visual field exclusively; however when your fingers are presented on both sides simultaneously, the patient only reports seeing the fingers on your left hand (her right visual field). What type of lesion is consistent with these findings?",
      "options": [" A lesion in the right frontal lobe  ", " A lesion in the left parietal lobe  ", " A lesion in the left frontal lobe  ", " A lesion in the right parietal lobe  ", " A lesion in the right occipital lobe  "],
      "answers": [" A lesion in the right parietal lobe  "],
      "explanation": "This type of finding is consistent with a person who suffers from a right parietal lobe lesion. Remember, the right side of the brain processes info from the left side of the body and visual field. A person who has this type of lesion may also demonstrate visual neglect, meaning that they will ignore the half of their body on the opposite side of the lesion. For example a person with a right parietal lesion will apply make-up to the right side of her face but not the left side. The neglect is much more pronounced if a person is presented with stimuli to both sides of their visual field simultaneously. For this reason it is important to test confrontational fields on both sides of the visual field at the same time in order to manifest a phenomenon called visual/parietal extinction. In this phenomenon, the object presented contralateral to the lesion will not be seen by the patient because it is extinguished by the object presented on the unaffected side. This allows for easier detection of a potential lesion, and it just takes a few more seconds of chair time for the patient."

      ],
      "answers": [" A dense unilateral cataract  "],
      "explanation": "The afferent pathway (the pathway from the eye to the brain) is evaluated by having the patient focus on a distant target under moderate lighting conditions. A bright controlled light source (transilluminator) is then directed from below the patient's line of sight into the pupil. A normal pupil will quickly constrict and then slowly increase in size until it is mid-dilated, followed by hippus. This procedure is then repeated on the other eye. The light source is then alternated quickly back and forth between the pupils to evaluate the consensual response. Damage to the afferent pathway will cause an afferent pupil defect or light-near dissociation. Light-near dissociation occurs when the pupil response to a near stimulus is greater than the pupil reaction to light. &#10;&#10;Afferent pupillary defects are observed if there is retinal or optic nerve damage. However, the damage between the eyes must be asymmetrical in order for an APD to be observed. Even a small amount of nerve damage may cause an APD, whereas a much larger degree of retinal damage is required to produce an APD. As long as the light source used is adequate, a dense cataract or a corneal scar should (in theory) not cause an APD. &#10;&#10;Reference: &#10;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3588138/"

      "explanation": "When investigating the etiology of a pupil abnormality, it is important to first determine which pupil is affected; this is accomplished by measuring pupil diameter sizes in both bright and dim light. Cases in which anisocoria is more prevalent in bright lighting suggests that the abnormal pupil is the larger pupil, as it will not constrict in the presence of light. Anisocoria that is more obvious in dim lighting suggests that the smaller pupil is abnormal because it does not dilate at the same rate as the normal pupil. &#10;&#10;Possible causes of an abnormal dilated pupil in which anisocoria is greater in bright light: &#10;- Adie's tonic pupil: pupil is irregular, reacts minimally to a light stimulus and slowly to a near target demand; over time, an Adie's pupil may become miotic &#10;- Cranial nerve III (oculomotor palsy): will present with associated ptosis and extraocular muscle palsies &#10;- Pharmacologically dilated pupil: typically has a history of getting some type of pharmacologic agent in the eye; reaction to light depends on when the offending agent came in contact with the eye &#10;- Iris sphincter damage (trauma): usually associated with a torn pupil margin, or iris transillumination defects"

      "explanation": "The near reflex is activated when a person changes gaze from a distant to a near object. It is comprised of a triad of accommodation, convergence, and pupil miosis. Vision is not required for this response, and there is no clinical condition in which the pupillary light reflex is intact and the near response is absent. However, there are several conditions that are associated with dissociation of light and near responses in which the light reflex is either absent or sluggish and the near response is normal. Although the final pathways for both responses are identical, the center for the near reflex is controlled by a supranuclear influence."

An interesting point to note is that the dazzle reflex is still intact in patients suffering from cortical blindness. &#10;&#10;The menace reflex also results in bilateral reflexive closure of the eyelids but occurs in response to an object that rapidly approaches the eye.

      "answers": [" Cranial nerve II  "],
      "explanation": "The neurological integrity of cranial nerve II is assessed via the pupillary reflexes. The afferent pathway (the pathway from the eye to the brain) is evaluated by having the patient focus on a distant target under moderate lighting conditions.

A normal pupil will quickly constrict and then slowly increase in size until it is mid-dilated followed by hippus. The procedure is then repeated on the other eye. The light source is then alternated quickly back and forth between the pupils to evaluate the consensual response. Damage to the afferent pathway will cause an afferent pupil defect or light-near dissociation. Light-near dissociation occurs when the pupil response to a near stimulus is greater than the pupil reaction to light. Pupillary reflexes also test the efferent pathway (from the brain to the eye), which is controlled, in part, by cranial nerve III and the oculo-sympathetic pathway. If there is cranial nerve III damage, the pupillary response to bright light will be decreased, but the consensual response will remain unaffected or there will be a change in the pupil size of one eye (as long as the damage is unilateral or asymmetrical).&#10;PowerPage&#10;Cranial Nerves Part I"

      "explanation": "Marcus-Gunn jaw winking is a phenomenon that is thought to occur as a result of an abnormal connection between cranial nerve V and cranial nerve III. Branches from the motor root of the trigeminal nerve that are meant for the ipsilateral pterygoid muscle aberrantly connect with the ipsilateral levator muscle instead. This allows for an elevation effect of the upper eyelid when jaw movements are initiated. This type of aberrant innervation may occur in up to 5% of patients presenting with a congenital ptosis; it tends to lessen in severity with age. This condition should not be confused with aberrant regeneration of cranial nerve VII; it is an isolated neurologic finding and does not require further work-up. Furthermore, Marcus-Gunn jaw winking is typically monitored indefinitely unless there is cosmetic concern and/or surgical intervention is desired."

      "explanation": "The subarachnoid space of the optic nerve is continuous with that of the brain. The subarachnoid space exists between the arachnoid and the pia mater and ends at the lamina cribrosa where it folds back on itself and terminates in a cul-de-sac. This space is filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and therefore should anything cause an increase in CSF pressure, this can translate down to the nerve and manifest as papilledema. &#10;&#10;The dural sinuses are venous channels that carry blood from the brain to the heart, not cerebrospinal fluid. &#10;&#10;The dura is generally firmly attached to the skull or bones and the arachnoid is connected to the dura. In the event of injury, trauma or sickness the dura and arachnoid may become separated resulting in a space called the subdural space. &#10;&#10;In a healthy individual there should not exist a space underneath the pia mater.

The pupil size should evaluated in both bright and dim illumination; physiological anisocoria should be the same under both lighting conditions (or somewhat greater in dim light). The lid positions should then be evaluated for possible ptosis. The pupillary response to direct light and the consensual light response should also be assessed in order to rule out pathology. The near response may also be evaluated, however if the direct response is normal, then there is no need to check the near response. Lastly, the patient should be evaluated for the presence of an APD. If all of the findings are normal, it is best to get confirmation of the stability of the anisocoria by observing previous photos of the patient. Some studies report that physiological anisocoria can be present in up to 20% of patients. &#10;&#10;Reference: Shah, S and Kelly, K.

      "answers": [" Sildenafil  "],
      "explanation": "Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is an ocular condition that typically presents as a sudden, painless loss of vision that is thought to be triggered by inadequate perfusion of the optic nerve head. This eventually leads to infarction, causing swelling and compression of the tissue, ischemia, and further infarction. Unlike an arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, there typically aren't any warning signs of the impending condition, but there have been associated risk factors identified of which clinicians should be aware. These predisposing factors include a small optic disc with a small or crowded cup (known as a 'disc at risk'). In these cases, if the disc begins to swell, the fibers have no place to go except to further compress on nearby axons, which leads to further swelling. Nocturnal (or nighttime) hypotension is also thought to be a risk factor due to the fact that many cases of NAION occur upon wakening or shortly thereafter. Several studies have also found a connection between sleep apnea and cases of NAION. &#10;&#10;When it comes to medication correlations, there have been several reported cases of NAION occurring in men after taking sildenafil citrate (Viagra®). The exact mechanism is unclear; however, it is believed that because the drug is involved in modulating blood vessel diameter, it is also then likely to have an effect on perfusion to the optic nerve tissue."

      "answers": [" Inferior-nasal  "],
      "explanation": "The optic chiasm is formed by the union of the right and left optic nerves. It is in this area that the fibers originating from the nasal retina (temporal visual field) decussate to join the uncrossed temporal fibers (nasal visual field) and course posteriorly as the optic tracts. &#10;&#10;The inferior nasal fibers remain low as they traverse the optic chiasm and decussate more anteriorly. Because of their location, these fibers are more vulnerable to damage from expanding pituitary lesions, leading to involvement of the superior temporal visual fields early in the disease. It is also important to note that these inferior-nasal fibers actually loop forward into the contralateral optic nerve before coursing posteriorly in the optic tract. This region is known as the anterior knee of von Willebrand. &#10;&#10;The superior nasal fibers remain high as they traverse the optic chiasm and decussate more posteriorly. Therefore, these fibers are typically first involved in cases of lesions growing from above the optic chiasm (craniopharyngiomas), affecting the inferior temporal visual fields early in the disease progression."

Conversely, the main trunk of the third nerve is supplied by the vasa nervorum, which courses internally in the nerve. Due to the location of pupillary fibers and the difference in blood supply to the superficial and internal fibers of the oculomotor nerve, certain features that present in cases of third nerve palsies can help differentiate a 'surgical' from a 'medical' lesion. &#10;&#10;Surgical lesions (aneurysms, trauma, uncal herniation) characteristically involve the pupil due to compression of the superficially coursing pupillary fibers and pial blood vessels. These cases are known as 'pupil involving third nerve palsies.'

      "options": [" Multiple sclerosis   ", " Bell's palsy  ", " Pseudotumor cerebri  ", " Lyme disease  "],
      "answers": [" Multiple sclerosis   "],
      "explanation": "An internuclear ophthalmoplegia is caused by an interruption or dysfunction in the medial longitudinal fasciculus. This is a heavily myelinated tract, and the clinical disturbance is a failure of conjugate lateral gaze. When an attempt to look to the right is made, the affected eye (in this case, the left eye) cannot adduct (move in to maintain conjugate gaze) while the unaffected eye (in this case, the right eye) will usually manifest a nystagmus due to overcompensation during abduction. In young patients, either a one-sided or bilateral INO is highly suggestive of multiple sclerosis. In older patients, it may represent a vascular defect or stroke. &#10;&#10;Lyme disease does not produce INOs but can present with facial palsy; it is said that bilateral facial palsies are pathognomonic for Lyme disease. Bell's palsy is a paralysis of the seventh cranial nerve (CN VII). Pseudotumor cerebri is a defect in the reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid leading to elevated intracranial pressure and the finding of papilledema. It is most commonly seen in young overweight females."

      "answers": [" Papilledema  "],
      "explanation": "Papilledema is defined as passive swelling of the optic disc caused by increased intracranial pressure, usually as a result of intracranial tumors or malignant hypertension. The condition is almost always bilateral, and vision is usually normal unless there is associated edema or exudates in the macular area. &#10;&#10;Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve that can occur at any location as it courses from the eye. It is typically caused by swelling and destruction of the myelin sheath that surrounds the nerve. &#10;&#10;Papillitis is a specific type of optic neuritis in which there is an inflammation of the optic nerve head. This condition is almost always unilateral, and because the optic nerve is inflamed, it is commonly associated with vision loss. &#10;&#10;Ischemic optic neuropathy is caused by obstruction of blood flow to the optic nerve, resulting in the loss of structure or function of a portion of the nerve. It is classified as either arteritic or non-arteritic, according to the location of the nerve that is affected. Patients with this condition will often present with acute loss of visual acuity and an altitudinal visual field defect."

      "answers": [" Post-ganglionic parasympathetic  "],
      "explanation": "An Adie's tonic pupil is usually an idiopathic, benign form of internal ophthalmoplegia that occurs as a result of damage and subsequent denervation of the postganglionic parasympathetic pupillomotor fibers. These fibers originate from the ciliary ganglion (which is located within the muscle cone, just behind the globe), and travel forward to eventually supply the pupil sphincter. &#10;&#10;Around 90% of patients presenting with an Adie's pupil are women, typically between the ages of 20 and 40. The condition is unilateral in 80% of cases; however, involvement of the fellow eye may develop later. Initially, anisocoria is present, in which the abnormal eye is dilated and reacts poorly to light and accommodates poorly. Slit-lamp evaluation will commonly show an iris that exhibits segmental contraction in response to light (vermiform movement). Later, the affected pupil will become miotic ('little old Adie's')."

      "answers": [" Bergmeister's papilla   "],
      "explanation": "Bergmeister's papilla is an uncommon, unilateral, congenital anomaly in which a white, fibrous, avascular tissue (representing the persistence of the hyaloid system) remains attached to the surface of the optic disc. This glial tissue may overlie the disc or peripapillary region. Visual function is normal in these patients. &#10;&#10;Prepapillary loops are characterized by a unilateral vascular loop that extends from the optic disc into the vitreous cavity and back. &#10;&#10;The appearance of myelinated nerve fibers occurs when optic nerve myelination extends past the region of the cribriform plate, allowing the ganglion cells to retain a myelin sheath that may be observed during fundus examination. The condition is typically unilateral, and vision is also not affected. &#10;&#10;A Mittendorf dot represents the anterior remnant of the hyaloid artery. This condition appears as a tiny white dot on the posterior surface of the crystalline lens upon direct examination and as a black dot with retro-illumination. &#10;&#10;Thin strands that can be observed crossing the pupil on slit-lamp biomicroscopy are considered persistent pupillary membranes and represent remnants of the fetal iris membrane."

      "answers": [" Pretectal nucleus to Edinger-Westphal nucleus  "],
      "explanation": "The pupillary light reflex begins with the retinal photoreceptors and is composed of four neurons, ending at the iris sphincter. The first neuron connects each retina with both pretectal nuclei that reside in the midbrain in the area of the superior colliculi. Fibers running from the nasal retina decussate at the optic chiasm and pass along the opposite optic tract, reaching the contralateral pretectal nucleus. &#10;&#10;Contrastingly, impulses originating at the temporal retina are conducted by fibers that traverse the ipsilateral optic tract, terminating at the ipsilateral pretectal nucleus. The second neuron in this pupillary light reflex connects each pretectal nucleus to both the ipsilateral and contralateral Edinger-Westphal nuclei. It is because of these connections that a light stimulus presented to one eye will evoke a bilateral and symmetrical pupillary constriction. Damage to these neurons (also known as intercalated neurons) is responsible for light near dissociation that is commonly associated with neurosyphilis. The next neuron in this pathway connects the Edinger-Westphal nucleus to the ipsilateral ciliary ganglion, while the final neuron leaves the ciliary ganglion and terminates at the iris sphincter muscle."

      "answers": [" Hypothalamus--> ciliospinal center of Budge--> superior cervical ganglion--> ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve  "],
      "explanation": "The oculosympathetic pathway contains three neurons as it courses from the brain to structures of the eye. The first neuron (central neuron) in this pathway begins at the posterior region of the hypothalamus. It descends down the brainstem to synapse at the ipsilateral ciliospinal center of Budge, which lies between C8 and T2 of the spinal cord. The second neuron (pre-ganglionic neuron) traverses a long course from the ciliospinal center to the superior cervical ganglion in the neck region. During its path, it is closely related to the apical area of the lung where it can be damaged by a Pancoast tumor, or in some cases, during surgery on the neck. The final neuron in the oculosympathetic pathway (post-ganglionic neuron) ascends with the internal carotid artery where it eventually enters the cavernous sinus and joins with the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. From here, the sympathetic fibers reach the pupil dilator and ciliary body by means of the long ciliary nerves and nasociliary nerves."

      "explanation": "Direct testing of his pupils will reveal little to no response in his right eye, and his anisocoria will be present equally in both dim and bright illumination because his iris sphincter is essentially paralyzed. There will not be a light-near dissociation because the pupil will be unable to react in either situation. The best way to evaluate that the pathway is intact is to assess the pupils using the reverse swinging flashlight test (RSFLT). The RSFLT compares the direct response of the reactive pupil to the consensual response of that same eye, in this case the left eye. Because the right pupil has been rendered unreactive by a dilating agent, and not due to pathology, both the direct and consensual pupillary reactions of the left eye should be intact."

      "options": [" Superior temporal  ", " Inferior nasal  ", " Inferior temporal  ", " Superior nasal   "],
      "answers": [" Superior temporal  "],
      "explanation": "A patient who has tilted discs will have an optic nerve that exits the eye superiorly, and may be accompanied by situs inversus, fundus ectasia, myopia, and superior temporal visual field defects that do not generally respect the midline. Sometimes the visual field defects can appear similar to those of a person who suffers from a pituitary tumor. It is important to distinguish between the two and this situation requires further evaluation."

      "question": "A healthy retinal nerve fiber layer is thickest at which portion of the optic nerve head?",
      "options": [" Superiorly  ", " Nasally  ", " Temporally  ", " Inferiorly  "],
      "answers": [" Inferiorly  "],
      "explanation": "The nerve fiber layer is thickest at the inferior and superior regions of the nerve, respectively. The inferior and superior arcades are composed of large diameter axons with little overlap of the receptive fields, thus explaining why a field defect occurs in these regions first for early cases of glaucoma. Inferior or superior notching of the nerve is highly suspect for glaucomatous damage, and must undergo further testing in order to rule out glaucoma. The next thickest area of nerve fiber layer tissue is nasally, which is comprised of the nasal radial fibers. These axons are affected in the later stages of glaucoma, thus explaining why a temporal island of the visual field is often left remaining in advanced cases of glaucoma. Lastly, the temporal rim area is the thinnest. Temporal rim tissue is comprised of the papillomacular bundle. The fibers in this area are very small and compact, with a high degree of receptive field overlap, therefore because of the receptive field redundancy, a visual field defect correlating to this region will occur only after significant fiber loss has occurred. Due to the fact that these fibers are so small in diameter, even though they are numerous, the fibers do not occupy a lot of space in the optic nerve. The thickness of the nerve fiber layer rim tissue is best remembered as ISNT, with inferior being the thickest and temporal rim tissue being the thinnest."

      "answers": [" The right superior oblique  "],
      "explanation": "Fibers of the trochlear nerve decussate, and therefore innervate, the CONTRALATERAL superior oblique muscle. The superior oblique is responsible for incyclotorsion, depression, and abduction. Cranial nerve (CN) IV is unique in that it travels the longest intracranial course when compared to all of the other cranial nerves. The trochlear nerve is also the smallest cranial nerve, and because this nerve is so thin it is prone to damage. A CN IV palsy will cause a hypertropia of the eye on the affected side and the patient will report vertical diplopia that is worse in downgaze and at near."

The disc serves as the convergent point for axons of the nerve fiber layer which then form the optic nerve to convey visual information to the brain for further processing. The actual optic disc does not contain photoreceptors and thus will not generate nervous signals. This explains why this area is also known as the 'blind spot'."

      "explanation": "The optic nerve head, also known as the blind spot, will demonstrate a sensitivity of 0 decibels, because this area of the eye does not contain any visual receptors, and therefore does not possess any viable vision. The area of the retina with the highest decibel level (hence the highest sensitivity) as seen with visual field testing is the fovea. The sensitivity to stimuli decreases with increasing distance from the fovea."

      "explanation": "Bell's palsy is an idiopathic isolated peripheral palsy of the ipsilateral seventh cranial nerve (facial nerve).

      "answers": [" Mature cataract  "],
      "explanation": "A relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) occurs in patients who have a history of an incomplete optic nerve lesion (a complete lesion would result in an absolute afferent pupillary defect), or the presence of severe retinal disease. The clinical features of a relative afferent pupillary defect include a pupil that responds weakly to light stimulation in the diseased eye and briskly to light stimulation in the normal eye. The results are exaggerated during the swinging flashlight test, in which both eyes will constrict when the normal eye is presented with a light stimulus, and both eyes will slowly dilate when the diseased eye is presented with the same amount of light. This anomalous result of dilation of the pupils in response to light occurs because the normal dilation that occurs when the light is withdrawn from the normal eye is more pronounced than the constriction that is produced by stimulating the abnormal eye. &#10;&#10;There are several conditions that may cause an afferent pupillary defect. These include severe retinal diseases, or macular scarring, severe asymmetric glaucoma, an optic nerve glioma or meningioma, central retinal artery occlusion or ischemic central retinal vein occlusion, optic neuritis, or any lesion that occurs along any segment of the optic nerve, usually prior to the chiasm. A dense cataract will never cause a relative afferent pupillary defect in the same eye, and should, therefore, never be used to explain the presence of an RAPD."

      "answers": [" Bilateral Argyll Robertson pupil  "],
      "explanation": "Bilateral Argyll Robertson pupils are a highly specific sign found in patients with neurosyphilis. In these cases, patients typically present with small pupils that do not respond well to light but will exhibit significant constriction when fixation on a near object occurs. This is usually bilateral but may be asymmetrical. This particular finding is also known as 'light-near dissociation.' The exact pathophysiology of this condition is not completely known; however, most investigators believe that syphilis damages the intercalated neurons that make the connection between the pretectal nucleus and each Edinger-Westphal nuclei. &#10;&#10;There are other conditions that may cause bilateral light-near dissociation such as diabetes, myotonic dystrophy, Parinaud's dorsal midbrain syndrome, familial amyloidosis, encephalitis, and chronic alcoholism. Disorders that may result in unilateral light-near dissociation include Adie's tonic pupil, herpes zoster ophthalmicus, and aberrant regeneration of the 3rd nerve."

She complains that she is extremely photophobic and her eyes are red, painful, and are tearing excessively. She was out water-skiing yesterday and was not wearing sunglasses. Based upon the above information, what is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [" Acanthamoeba keratitis  ", " Medicamentosa  ", " Dry eye syndrome  ", " Ultraviolet radiation keratitis  "],
      "answers": [" Ultraviolet radiation keratitis  "],
      "explanation": "Ultraviolet radiation keratitis occurs secondary to over-exposure to wavelengths of radiation that are between 260-280 nm. When the ocular surface is exposed, it essentially becomes 'sunburned', leading to superficial punctate keratopathy (SPK), conjunctival injection, and a potential iridocyclitis. The patient will experience various levels of pain (depending on the length of exposure), excessive lacrimation, and photophobia. Treatment includes a bandage contact lens with topical antibacterial drops to ensure a sterile environment, sunglasses, and management of any iridocyclitis if present. &#10;&#10;Medicamentosa refers to the situation in which a patient reacts to medication or the preservatives contained within an ophthalmic preparation. Symptoms include pain, foreign body sensation, burning, and photophobia depending on the severity. Ocular signs include conjunctival injection, SPK, chemosis, and ulceration and scarring in very severe cases. Treatment includes discontinuation of the offending agent and management of the inflammation with preservative-free ocular lubricants and topical steroids if necessary. &#10;&#10;Acanthamoeba keratitis is a fairly rare phenomenon and occurs with contact lens abuse or ocular trauma with exposure to contaminated water. It may also occur in patients who clean their contact lenses with water or unpreserved contact lens solution. Early signs of the condition include epithelial mottling, making it very hard to distinguish from Herpes simplex. Characteristic signs of this infection are a corneal ring infiltrate (which occurs later in the course of the condition) and severe pain that is highly out of proportion to the ocular signs. The prognosis for this disease improves if it is diagnosed and treated early. Acanthamoeba is very aggressive and difficult to treat in the later stages and carries a high risk of blindness. Treatment includes the use of topical agents such as Neosporin® (bacitracin, neomycin and polymyxin B) and Brolene® (dibrompropamidine isethionate) used in conjunction with one another. Due to the high potential of blindness and difficulty associated with managing this condition, it is best to refer to a corneal specialist.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Acanthamoeba"

      "options": [" Administration of Benadryl (oral)  ", " Injection of epinephrine (EpiPen)  ", " Olopatadine (Patanol)  ", " Prednisone (oral)  "],
      "answers": [" Injection of epinephrine (EpiPen)  "],
      "explanation": "Anaphylactic shock is defined as a severe, multi-system, type I hypersensitive, acute allergic reaction that may be life-threatening. Signs of an allergic reaction include tingling, itching, hives, swelling of lips and tongue, constriction of the airway, vasodilation, myocardial depression, and a decrease in blood pressure. The EpiPen is injected intramuscularly to the upper lateral thigh to ensure rapid delivery. Epinephrine (Adrenaline) activates both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors causing an increase in peripheral vascular resistance and allowing for an increase in blood pressure and coronary artery perfusion. Adrenaline also serves to reverse vasodilation and decrease urticaria and angioedema. For severe, life-threatening reactions, Benadryl (diphenhydramine) will not work quickly enough. Topical antihistamines have little if any systemic absorption and therefore will not be effective in counteracting the anaphylaxis. While oral steroids may be useful in the post-management of anaphylactic shock, they will not yield the desired immediate response.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Anaphylaxis"

Irrigation of the eye should begin as soon as the patient walks through the door. &#10;&#10;Office treatment of patients with chemical burns should adhere to the following procedures: &#10;- Immediate, copious irrigation is crucial in order to minimize the contact time of the eye and the chemical and to normalize the pH in the conjunctival fornices as soon as possible &#10;- Normal saline solution should be used to constantly irrigate the eye for at least 15-30 minutes or until the pH is neutralized &#10;- Testing the eye with litmus paper is the best way to establish pH (wait a few minutes after stopping irrigation) &#10;- Do not try to neutralize the pH faster by using other types of solutions; this can cause further damage due to unwanted reactions that can release harmful substrates &#10;- If the initial contact with the patient is via telephone, advise the patient to flush their eye with solution (or water) for 20-30 minutes before coming to your office &#10;- Double-eversion of the eyelids should be performed along with swabbing of the fornices with a cotton-tipped applicator so that any retained particulate matter that may be trapped can be removed (more common in cases with lime or cement)"

It may also occur in patients who clean their contact lenses with water or unpreserved contact lens solution. Early signs of the condition include epithelial mottling, making it very hard to distinguish from Herpes simplex. A detailed case history is helpful in the diagnosis of this pathogen.

Due to the high potential of blindness and difficulty associated with managing this condition, it is best to refer to a corneal specialist. &#10;&#10;Chlamydia causes two forms of conjunctivitis: trachoma and inclusion. Trachoma is more common in lesser-developed countries and can cause blindness if not treated appropriately. Trachoma presents in several stages, initially starting with mucopurulent discharge, lymphadenopathy, red eye, small superior tarsal follicles, and mild superior pannus. This infection eventually progresses to horrible scarring of the eyelid and cornea, causing extremely poor visual acuity. Treatment includes oral doxycycline, tetracycline, or erythromycin along with topical tetracycline or erythromycin ointment. &#10;&#10;Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is a very common and contagious infection of viral etiology. EKC is caused by the adenovirus (of which there are many different strains), but the most common to cause ocular infections are serotypes 8 and 19. EKC is said to follow the 'rule of 8s' because type 8 is the type most frequently isolated; on the 8th day the patient will present will diffuse superficial punctate keratitis (SPK), followed 8 days later (16 days from inoculation) by the formation of sub-epithelial infiltrates (SEIs). Once SEIs are present, the patient is no longer considered contagious. Signs of EKC include follicular conjunctivitis, positive lymph adenopathy, and mild lid edema. Small sub-conjunctival hemorrhages, pseudo-membranes, and iritis may also be present. Treatment for this condition is generally palliative and consists of ocular lubrication, topical vasoconstrictors, cool or warm compresses, topical NSAIDs, and sunglasses. Some clinicians use a Betadine (5%) ophthalmic solution off-label treatment in office, which seems to work rather well. The use of steroids is still controversial because EKC and the Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can initially present similarly, and steroid use on HSV can lead to horrendous corneal damage. Topical steroids are very effective if the patient suffers from SEIs that are visually debilitating, but be sure to taper the steroid use. &#10;&#10;Bacterial ulcers do not cause ring infiltrates, and the level of pain experienced by the patient is generally proportional to the signs observed in the office. &#10;&#10;Verruca is a common type of wart that may be observed on the lid margins or around the eye. Patients may experience a watery discharge, SPK, a follicular reaction, and lymphadenopathy if the virus sheds its cells into the eye. Treatment involves removal of the wart.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Acanthamoeba"

      "answers": [" Prednisolone (Pred-Forte®) 1% eye drops   "],
      "explanation": "Pred-Forte® or any steroid drop should NEVER be used alone on an infected eye regardless of the offending pathogen. Steroids serve to suppress the immune system's response, resulting in a decreased inflammatory reaction. Because of the diminished response due to steroid use, the body's ability to fight the cause of the infection decreases, resulting in a heightened infection. HSV is commonly treated with steroid drops, particularly when there is stromal involvement; however, the drops are used in conjunction with an anti-viral agent. Artificial tears are frequently used to keep the eye flushed and clean, thereby speeding up the healing period. The use of artificial tears in the absence of any other medication will not worsen the infection, nor will it serve greatly in its treatment. Vidarabine and ganciclovir are both anti-viral medications that are helpful in the treatment of HSV. Ganciclovir has a slight advantage over vidarabine in that it has proven to demonstrate less corneal toxicity."

      "explanation": "The total power of a lens-mirror combination can be determined using the formula Dlm = 2 D1 + P(n'), where Dlm= the power of the lens-mirror combination, D1= the front surface power, and n'= the index of refraction of the lens. However, the power of the mirror must first be determined using the formula P= -2n/r, where P= the power of the mirror in diopters, n= the index of refraction and r= the radius of curvature of the mirror in meters. Solve for P = -2(1.49)/0.098 = -30.40 D. Solve for Dlm= 2(-5.00) + -30.40 D = -40.40 D. It is important to note that because the lens is equiconcave, the power of the front surface is equivalent to the back surface D1=D2. Because the total power of the lens is -10.00 D, we know that the front surface power is -5.00 D. Also, when determining the power of the mirror, you must be sure to watch your signs!! The radius of curvature is positive and the power of the mirror is negative because the mirror is convex and would diverge light."

Prism can be induced when a patient is looking above/below or lateral to the optical centers of a spectacle lens. For the above problem, 1.2 pd=(d)(-8.00 D) solving for d yields 0.15 cm or 1.5 mm. The patient must look through the temporal aspect of the lens in order to achieve base out prism."

      "answers": [" 1.95 prism diopters   "],
      "explanation": "In order to determine the amount of compounded prism, one must first determine the length of the resultant vector. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the third component of our triangle. We know that one side measures 5 mm and the other measures 6 mm; now we need to determine the hypotenuse. The Pythagorean theorem states that: a2+b2= c2; therefore, solving for c yields: 25+36 = c2, c = 7.8 mm. Now, to determine the amount of prism, input this value into Prentice's rule: prism diopters = d*F, where d is equal to the distance from the optical center in centimeters and F=the power of the lens in the desired meridian in diopters. X=(0.78)(-2.50), x=1.95 prism diopters."

The optic disc serves as the convergent point for axons of the nerve fiber layer the axons then form the optic nerve to convey visual information to the brain for further processing. The actual optic disc does not contain photoreceptors and thus will not generate nervous signals. This explains why this area is also known as the 'blind spot'."

      "answers": [" √1.586   "],
      "explanation": "Antireflective coatings are applied to ophthalmic lenses to increase the amount of light that is transmitted through the lens thereby minimizing the overall amount of light that is reflected off the surface of the lens. The higher the index of refraction of the lens, the greater the amount of reflection experienced. Antireflective coatings minimize reflections by creating destructive interference. The coating causes the reflected light from the surface of the lens to be 180 degrees out of phase with the light that is reflected from the coating. To optimize the antireflective property of the coating, the coating's index of refraction should be equal to the square root of the index of refraction of the lens. For the above question, the index of refraction of polycarbonate lenses is 1.586 and the square root of 1.586 is 1.259."

      "options": [" 1.8 prism diopters base down   ", " 4.2 prism diopters base down  ", " 2.4 prism diopters base down  ", " 6.6 prism diopters base down  "],
      "answers": [" 1.8 prism diopters base down   "],
      "explanation": "Use the Prentice rule to solve this problem: prism diopters(pd) =d*F, where d= the distance from the optical center in centimeters and F= the power of the lens in the desired meridian in diopters. In this instance, the patient is looking through base down prism in both eyes, which will cancel some of the prismatic effect as the bases are aligned. Solving for the amount of prism on the right eye, pd=0.6(-4.00)= 2.4 base down prism. Solve for the left eye: pd=0.6(-7.00)=4.2 base down prism. Subtract the two to determine the total prismatic effect experienced by the patient: 4.2-2.4=1.8 base down prism. Alternatively, you can omit one of the steps by initially determining the total power difference in the vertical meridian between the two lenses, which is 3.00 D (7-4=3). Then you can multiply this power difference by the distance between the patient's line of sight and the optical center, which is 6 mm in this question. Pd=0.6(3)= 1.8 prism diopters base down over the left eye. Generally, vertical imbalances of smaller magnitudes do not pose too much of a problem for single vision lenses as the patient can tilt her head to re-align the optical centers with her line of sight, thus eliminating any possible diplopia.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Important Formulas"

      "explanation": "A thin lens is a two-surface lens system in which the center thickness of the lens is so small that it can be given a value of zero. Therefore, the two refractions that occur at each of the two surfaces when a ray of light passes through the system can be simplified and treated as a single refraction. &#10;&#10;When determining the focal lengths of a thin lens, the appropriate equations are as follows: &#10;f=-n/D and f'=n/D &#10;f= first focal length, f'= second focal length, n= index surrounding the lens, D= power of the lens &#10;In this case, the lens is surrounded by air; therefore n= 1.00 and the power of the lens is +5.00D. &#10;Substituting these values leaves f= -1.0/+5.00, and f'= 1.0/+5.00 &#10;f= -.20 m (or -20 cm) and f'= +.20 m (or +20 cm) &#10;&#10;Keep in mind that for a thin lens in air, the focal lengths will be equidistant but opposite in sign.

      "explanation": "For vertical prism, if the bases are oriented in the same direction, they will cancel each other out. When the bases are oriented in opposite directions in the vertical meridian (i.e., base up and base down), the powers will add together. The opposite holds true for prisms with their bases oriented horizontally. If the prism bases are both base out or base in, the powers are additive, while if they are opposite (that is, one is base in and one is base out), the powers will cancel."

For the majority of telescopes, the entrance pupil is also the objective lens. The exit pupil is the image of the entrance pupil (objective lens) as viewed through the ocular of the telescope. For a Galilean telescope, the exit pupil is virtual and is located inside the telescope. A Keplerian telescope possesses a real exit pupil."

The measurement should then be taken from this point to the lowest portion of the groove of the lower eyewire (this may not be directly below the center of the pupil). 0.50mm should be added to this measurement to take the bevel of the lens into consideration (as the groove of the frame is often not visible on full framed spectacles). 1.0mm should then be subtracted from this value to compensate for pupil clearance during fixation of the eye when viewing distance objects. &#10;Therefore; in the question above, the net segment height that should be ordered is 17.0mm + 0.50mm ? 1.0mm = 16.5mm."

      "explanation": "Prism can be induced when a patient is looking above/below or lateral to the optical centers of a spectacle lens. The induced prismatic effect from a spectacle lens is a function of the lens vertex power (Fv) and the distance between the patient's line of sight and the optical center of the lens (d). This prismatic effect can be calculated using Prentice's Rule: prism = d(Fv). It is important to remember that the unit for d is always in centimeters. &#10;&#10;When dealing with vertical prismatic effects, if the induced prism values over each eye have the same base direction, the prism values are subtracted. If prism values have opposite base directions, then the prism values are added. &#10;&#10;The base direction is dependent on whether the lens is a plus or minus powered prescription. Since a plus powered lens has a greater center thickness, looking above the optical center will induce base down (BD) prism, and looking below the optical center will induce base up prism (BU). A way to visualize this is to picture two prisms stacked together base to base, creating a thick center. The opposite is true for a minus lens, since the thickness of the lens is greatest at the edge. Looking above the optical center of a minus lens induces BU prism, and looking below the optical center induces BD prism. A minus lens can be visualized as two prisms stacked apex to apex, creating a thin center and thick edge. &#10;&#10;To determine the vertical prismatic imbalance in the question, calculate the induced prism effect of each eye: &#10;Right Eye: Prism = (0.8cm)(5D) = 4.0 BD &#10;Left Eye: Prism = (0.8cm)(2D) = 1.6 BD &#10;Each eye has the same base direction, so the values will be subtracted to determine the vertical prismatic imbalance. &#10;Imbalance = 4.0 - 1.6 = 2.4 BD over the right eye"

      "question": "A Galilean telescope has an ocular lens with a power of -32.00 D and an objective lens with a power of +8.00 D. What is the magnification provided by the telescope?",
      "options": [" 256x  ", " 8x  ", " 4x   ", " 0.25x  "],
      "answers": [" 4x   "],
      "explanation": "To calculate the magnification (M) of a telescope divide the power of the ocular lens (Doc) by the power of the objective lens (Dobj): M=-Doc/Dobj. In the example above, M=-(-32 D)/8 D= 4x. The magnification of a Galilean telescope is positive due to the fact that its ocular has a minus powered lens. The magnification of an astronomical telescope is negative and therefore its image will be upside down."

      "question": "A 15x telescope has an objective lens diameter of 20mm. What is the diameter of the exit pupil?",
      "options": [" 3.0 cm  ", " 0.75 mm  ", " 1.33 mm   ", " 2.8 mm  "],
      "answers": [" 1.33 mm   "],
      "explanation": "The exit pupil diameter can be determined by using the equation Mtel= objective lens diameter/exit pupil diameter, where Mtel= the magnification of the telescope. Solving for the diameter of the exit pupil (xp) yields, 15x=20 mm/ diameter xp= 1.33 mm. The amount of light that may enter a telescope is limited by the size of the entrance pupil. For the majority of telescopes, the entrance pupil is also the objective lens. The exit pupil is the image of the entrance pupil (objective lens) as viewed through the ocular of the telescope. For a Galilean telescope, the exit pupil is virtual and is located inside the telescope. A Keplerian telescope possesses a real exit pupil. When viewed through the telescope, the exit pupil will appear to have 'with motion' if it is virtual (Galilean telescope) or 'against motion' (Keplerian telescope) if the exit pupil is real."

      "question": "Your patient reports vertical diplopia when reading through her new bifocal lenses. The distance prescription for the right and left eyes are -10.00 DS and -4.00 DS respectively, with a +2.00 add. When the patient reads, her line of sight is 8 mm below the distance optical centers. How much slab-off prism is needed to correct the vertical imbalance and on which lens should it be placed?",
      "options": [" 3.2 prism diopters on the left lens  ", " 4.8 prism diopters on the right lens   ", " 4.8 prism diopters on the left lens  ", " 8 prism diopters on the left lens  ", " 8 prism diopters on the right lens  "],
      "answers": [" 4.8 prism diopters on the right lens   "],
      "explanation": "Use the Prentice rule to solve this problem: prism diopters(pd) =d*F where d= the distance from the optical center in centimeters and F= the power of the lens in the desired meridian in diopters. In this instance, the patient is looking through base down prism in both eyes, which will cancel some of the prismatic effect as the bases are aligned. Solving for the amount of prism on the right eye: pd=0.8(-10.00)= 8 base down prism. Solve for the left eye: pd=0.8(-4.00)= 3.2 base down prism. Subtract the two to determine the total prismatic effect experienced by the patient: 8-3.2 = 4.8 base down prism. Alternatively, you can omit one of the steps by initially determining the total power difference in the vertical meridian between the two lenses which, is 6.00 D (10-4=6). Then you can multiply this power difference by the distance between the patient's line of sight and the optical center, which is 8 mm in this question. Pd=0.8(6)= 4.8 prism diopters base down. Slab-off prism creates base up prism (remember you can feel and see the ledge in the center of the lens) and is placed on the most minus or least plus lens because it will possess the most base down prism. Generally it is best to round down the total amount of neutralizing prism used for slab-off.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Important Formulas"

The far point vergence at the spectacle plane necessary to obtain a clear image is the reciprocal of the far point, in meters. 1/0.50= 2.00 D. Therefore to achieve a clear retinal image for an object focused at optical infinity requires -3.25 D at the spectacle plane. Because the far point of 50 cm was determined with his current prescription in place, his prescription needs to be strengthened by the amount of the far point vergence required at the spectacle plane, which was -2.00 D in this case, and this value should be added to his prescription of -1.25 D."

If each segment must be at least 12mm in height to be useful, what is the minimum 'B' measurement needed?",

When a double segment bifocal is ordered, the top segment is automatically placed about 13-14mm above the lower segment line. The upper segment should be at least 12mm in height in order to be useful to the patient. A frame with a deep enough 'B' measurement is important in ensuring that both segments will fit properly in the frame. In regards to the question above, if both segments must be at least 12mm in height, and the distance between segments is automatically 13mm, the minimum 'B' measurement should be 37mm (12mm + 12mm + 13mm = 37mm)."

      "answers": [" 6th nerve   "],
      "explanation": "Due to its course through the brain, the sixth cranial nerve (abducens nerve) is most susceptible to compression in the presence of elevated intracranial pressure. The abducens nerve leaves the brainstem in the area of the junction of the pons and the medulla and enters the subarachnoid space when it emerges from the brainstem. It traverses superiorly and pierces the dura mater to run between the dura and the skull. It eventually reaches the tip of the temporal bone (petrous tip) and makes a sharp turn anteriorly to enter the cavernous sinus. This is the area that renders the sixth nerve susceptible to stretching and compression when intracranial pressure becomes elevated. From the cavernous sinus, the abducens nerve runs alongside the internal carotid artery then enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure, where it innervates the lateral rectus muscle of the eye."

      "answers": [" -4.90 D   "],
      "explanation": "In order to determine the total power, the power of each surface must be calculated. Because it is equiconcave, the power of the front surface is equal to the power of the back surface (D1=D2), therefore we only have to figure out the power of one surface and then multiply it by two. We also know that because it is a concave lens, it must have a negative power. Solve for the power of the first surface D1=n'-n/r1, where n'= the refractive index of the lens, n= the refractive index of the surrounding medium and r= the radius of curvature of the first surface in meters. D1= 1.49-1/-0.2=-2.45. Because we know that D1+D2 is the total power of the lens and D1=D2, we do not have to solve for D2; we can simply multiply -2.45 by 2 = -4.90 D, or add -2.45D+-2.45 D= -4.90 D."

      "answers": [" 1.66 prism diopters   "],
      "explanation": "PALs achieve a progressive increase in reading power as one views more inferiorly through the lens by steepening the lens curvature. This creates a thinner edge inferiorly. To counteract the decrease in lens thickness, yoked base down prism is added. However, because the same amount of prism in the same direction is added to each lens, there is no net prismatic effect experienced by the patient. Generally the amount of base down prism necessary is calculated by multiplying the add power by 2/3. In this case, 2/3*2.5 = 1.65666 or 1.66 rounded up. Keep in mind that yoked base up prism may be added in the event of moderate to high minus powered prescriptions (depending on the placement of the fitting cross). The addition of prism is called prism thinning because it allows for a decrease in the overall thickness of the final lens product. Prism-thinning can also be used to decrease the center thickness of PALs with plus powered lenses or with high add powers. &#10;&#10;Reference: Meister, D, Understanding Prism-Thinning, Lens Talk (1998) vol.26, No.35."

      "question": "A Galilean telescope possesses an eyepiece with a corresponding power of -30.00 D and provides an angular magnification of 5x. Which of the following will CORRECTLY solve for the power of the objective lens of the telescope?",

      "answers": [" 5x= -(-30.00)/(Dobj)   "],
      "explanation": "Using the formula M= -Doc/Dobj, where Doc= dioptric power of the oculars and Dobj= dioptric power of the objective lens one can solve for the dioptric power of the objective lens of the telescope. 5x= -(-30.00)/(Dobj). Solving for Dobj yields Dobj= -(-30.00)/(5x)= +6.00 D. Although the equation is not complex, it is important to include and keep track of positive and negative signs. Keplerian telescopes have positively powered objective and eyepiece lenses, whereas Galilean telescopes possess positively powered objective lenses but negatively powered ocular lenses or eyepieces."

      "explanation": "The minimum blank size (MBS) is the smallest diameter of lens that can be used to engineer a person's ophthalmic prescription. The minimum blank size is important to consider because a large blank size will generate more waste, increasing the cost of goods. Using a larger than necessary blank size may also affect the cosmesis of the lenses for hyperopes because use of a larger blank size increases the resultant overall central thickness of the lenses. &#10;In order to calculate the MBS, the total decentration must first be determined: &#10;Total decentration = (A + DBL) - PD &#10;Total decentration = (54 + 16) - 62 = 8mm &#10;Once the total decentration is known, the equation for MBS is as follows: &#10;MBS = ED + total decentration + 2mm &#10;MBS = 57 + 8 + 2 = 67mm &#10;&#10;Therefore, the minimum blank size necessary for the above patient is 67mm (the extra +2 in the MBS formula is added to allow for possible defects of the edge of the lens that may be present in the lens blank). &#10;&#10;System for Ophthalmic Dispensing (third edition).

      "answers": [" 3.5 prism diopters   "],
      "explanation": "Image jump is created by the vertical prismatic effect when looking through the reading addition of a bifocal lens. When the patient looks from the distance portion of their lenses into the reading area, the viewed image will appear to move or jump. The greater the distance between the reading add optical center and the bifocal line, the greater the image jump experienced by the patient. The total amount of image jump depends on the reading add and the distance between the optical center of the reading add and the segment line. The optical center of a round segment is located in the center of the segment, therefore one must divide the diameter of the segment by 2. For the above example, 28/2=14 mm. Next apply the Prentice rule to solve this problem: prism diopters(pd) =d*F where d is equal to the distance from the optical center in centimeters and F= the power of the add. Pd= 1.4(2.50) = 3.5 prism diopters."

      "explanation": "A 1.50 D uncorrected myopic female with 1.50 D amplitude of accommodation with have a near point of 33.3 cm. 1.50 D of myopia will allow her somewhat good near vision, which then adds to her amplitude of accommodation (which is 1.50 D). Therefore, 1.50 D + 1.50 D = 3.00 D. 1/3.00 D= 0.333 m or 33.3 cm. Her near point of accommodation is 33.3 cm; objects that are located closer than this will be blurry to the patient. An uncorrected emmetrope with 1.50 D of accommodation will be able to see objects that lie at 66.7 cm clearly when the eye is maximally accommodated (1/1.50=0.667 m or 66.7 cm). A 1.50 D hyperope needs to accommodate 1.50 D in order to achieve a clear image of a distant object. Therefore, a 1.50 D hyperope with a 1.50 D amplitude of accommodation will not be able to clearly visualize an object that is located closer than optical infinity."

Cases in which anisocoria is more prevalent in bright lighting suggests that the abnormal pupil is the larger pupil, as it will not constrict in the presence of light. Anisocoria that is more obvious in dim lighting suggests that the smaller pupil is abnormal because it does not dilate at the same rate as the normal pupil. &#10;&#10;Possible causes of an abnormally miotic pupil in which anisocoria is greater in dim light: &#10;- Horner's syndrome: in addition to a miotic pupil, patients will also present with a mild ptosis on the affected side, along with possible anhidrosis &#10;- Argyll Robertson pupil: the pupil will typically have an abnormal shape in addition to exhibiting a poor reaction to light but will constrict normally upon accommodation to a near target; although Argyll Robertson pupils are bilateral, there is usually a mild degree of asymmetry present &#10;- Iritis: patients will also complain of pain and redness, and cells and/or flare will be observable in the anterior chamber upon slit-lamp evaluation &#10;- Unilateral use of miotic agent: typically has a history of getting some type of pharmacologic agent in the eye, or rubbing the affected eye with a hand that inadvertently came in contact with a miotic agent &#10;- Long-standing Adie's pupil: Adie's pupils will initially present dilated but may become miotic over time; typically, there will also be an irregular and slow reaction to light stimuli"

Typically, the amount of edema can be classified depending on the severity of the presentation. In the very early stages of papilledema, hyperemia of the optic disc occurs, along with blurring of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer and optic disc margins, peripapillary flame-shaped hemorrhages, cessation of spontaneous venous pulsation, and swelling of the optic disc. When evaluating optic disc edema, the thickest areas of optic nerve tissue tend to appear swollen first (inferior, superior, and nasal regions), typically sparing the temporal aspect of the optic nerve in the very early stages of this condition. Eventually the temporal region will also swell, leading to obscuration of all borders of the optic disc."

Optic disc drusen often lead to elevation of the optic disc. There are, however, several distinguishing factors that may aid in the clinical diagnosis of optic disc drusen versus possible papilledema. &#10;- Anomalous retinal vascular patterns commonly occur in association with the presence of optic disc drusen; this may include early vascular branching and increased vessel tortuosity &#10;- Vessels coursing the optic disc in patients with optic disc drusen are not obscured, despite the presence of disc elevation; those presenting with papilledema will commonly exhibit obscuration of these vessels due to edema of the retinal nerve fiber layer &#10;- Hyperemia of the optic disc is associated with papilledema and does not occur in patients with optic disc drusen &#10;- About 80% of patients with optic disc drusen demonstrate a spontaneous venous pulsation (SVP), while the loss of SVP is one of the earliest signs of papilledema"

      "explanation": "There are general guidelines that lens manufacturers follow with regards to the shape of the front and back surfaces of spectacle lenses in order to minimize aberrations. These guidelines are based on the power of the spectacle lens needed. Generally, as the lens power becomes more minus, the front surface of the lens will flatten, while the back surface steepens. Conversely, as plus power increases, the front curve will become progressively steeper (while the back surface flattens). This results in minus lenses looking flat and plus lenses looking steep when viewed from the front. &#10;&#10;System for Ophthalmic Dispensing (third edition). Brookes, C.W., Borish, I.M. 2007.

      ],
      "answers": [" As the pupil size decreases, the distance between two point sources must be increased in order for the two point sources to be resolved   "],
      "explanation": "As the pupil size decreases, the amount of object defocus will decrease, as will the amount of light reaching the retina. Elderly patients often experience a phenomenon called senile miosis in which the size of the pupil is physiologically decreased, affording increased visual acuity secondary to a pinhole effect, along with an increased depth of field. However, the amount of light reaching the retina is diminished, which may cause a paradoxical and offsetting decrease in visual acuity. &#10;&#10;A decreased pupil size increases the amount of diffraction experienced. A resulting retinal diffraction pattern caused by a point source appears as alternating light and dark bands of concentric circles in a bull's eye configuration. The measured distance between the center light circle (peak) to the center of the adjacent dark band (trough) is known as Airy's disk. The radius of Airy's disk increases with decreased pupil size. If viewed through a small pupil, two point sources of light will create two retinal diffraction patterns. The two objects must be sufficiently far away from each other to be resolved as two separate objects. The minimum required distance separating the two objects to allow for proper resolution is the radius of Airy's disk (or when the peak of one Airy's disk falls on the trough of the other Airy's disk). Because the radius of Airy's disk increases (as does the size of the diffraction pattern) with decreased pupil size, the distance between two objects must also increase in order for the perception of two point sources to occur."

      "answers": [" Base in; the image of the object is shifted towards the apex of the prism   "],
      "explanation": "The clinical application of prisms may be useful for patients with phorias or tropias. Prisms cause light to deviate to the base, but the image will be displaced towards its apex. A symptomatic patient with exophoria will benefit from base in prism. A person with exophoria exhibits a tendency for the eyes to turn outwards. Placing base in prism over this patient's eyes will cause the image to be displaced towards the apex, shifting the image outward and thereby reducing the total demand of the patient on convergence. This reduces the symptoms of muscle stress described as asthenopia."

Prescribing plus cylinder with an axis of 180 degrees will cause stretching or elongation of images vertically. Minus cylinder prescribed with an axis of 90 degrees will minify images horizontally while plus cylinder at an axis of 90 degrees will magnify images horizontally.

      "explanation": "A fused bifocal is constructed by joining a bifocal segment made of a higher index material (usually flint glass) with the carrier lens made of a lower index material (usually crown glass) together under high heat and pressure. A plastic lens could not withstand such heat and pressure without warping or melting; thus, a fused bifocal is typically made of glass. A one-piece bifocal is constructed out of the same material with the segment having a change of curvature. A one-piece bifocal is usually plastic such as CR-39. You can feel the change of curvature of a plastic bifocal by running your finger across the top of the bifocal segment."

      "answers": [" Sunglasses with polarized lenses   "],
      "explanation": "Because the patient is an avid outdoor enthusiast and particularly spends a great deal of time on the water, he should be informed about the benefits of polarized lenses. There is a great deal of horizontally polarized light that reflects off of the surface of the water. Polarized lenses are generally constructed with a vertically-oriented filter, allowing only light parallel to this orientation to pass through the lens and blocking the transmission of horizontally-positioned light rays. Because the lenses filter the reflection off of the water surface, fish also become more visible to the observer."

      "answers": [" Dazzle reflex   ", " Menace reflex   ", " Glare reflex   "],
      "explanation": "The corneal reflex does not involve the optic nerve but occurs due to direct mechanical stimulation of the cornea which messengers the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve, which then sends a signal to the post-central gyrus. This signal is relayed to the midbrain stimulating the orbicularis and the lacrimal gland and inhibiting the action of the levator palpebrae superioris. &#10;&#10;The dazzle, menace and glare reflexes occur due to visual input in the absence of mechanical manipulation. &#10;&#10;The glare reflex is as follows: glare-> optic nerve-> cortex-> post-central gyrus-> inhibition of the levator palpebrae superioris and stimulation of the orbicularis. &#10;&#10;The dazzle reflex occurs as follows: bright light-> optic nerve-> visual cortex-> post-central gyrus-> superior colliculus-> stimulation of orbicularis and inhibition of levator palpebrae superioris. &#10;&#10;The menace reflex is outlined as follows: foreign object approaching globe-> optic nerve-> cortical association area-> post-central gyrus-> stimulation of orbicularis and inhibition of levator palpebrae superioris. &#10;&#10;The Babinski reflex occurs in infants.

The higher the prescription, the greater the magnification (or minification) experienced by a patient. There are several ways to decrease spectacle magnification. For a plus powered lens, increasing the index of refraction, decreasing the base curve, vertex distance or center thickness will reduce magnification. For a minus powered lens, spectacle minification can be lessened by decreasing the vertex distance or the index of refraction, and increasing the center thickness or base curve. Although this sounds backwards, remember that the goal for minus lenses is to reduce minification, or to increase magnification; and increasing the center thickness of the lens or decreasing the index will achieve this goal."

      ],
      "answers": [" Decreasing the magnitude of the dioptric power of the hand-held lens increases the magnification of the retinal image   "],
      "explanation": "There is an inverse relationship between magnification and the power of the hand-held lens when performing indirect ophthalmoscopy. Increasing the dioptric value of the hand-held lens will reduce the overall magnification but will increase the linear field of view. The image viewed through indirect ophthalmoscopy is inverted therefore when interpreting results be sure to know what area of the retina you are actually viewing."

      "explanation": "Optyl is a very commonly utilized frame material. Optyl does not shrink when it is heated or cooled, but instead expands with heat; therefore, when inserting lenses into an optyl frame, it is better to cut the lenses to be slightly oversized. A deviation of about 0.6 to 1.0mm larger than the measured frame opening is typical."

      "answers": [" Esodeviation worse with distance viewing   "],
      "explanation": "A cranial nerve (CN) VI palsy, or a palsy of the abducens nerve, will cause an esodiviation on the affected side and will result in horizontal diplopia, which worsens with distance viewing since this nerve innervates the lateral rectus muscle. The patient may present with a head turn towards the same side as the affected eye. For instance, if the patient has a right lateral rectus palsy, he or she may present with a head turn to the right to help eliminate diplopia. It helps to think in terms of function. The lateral recti serve to abduct the eyes, and distance viewing requires divergence, or a turning out of both eyes simultaneously. A CN VI palsy will therefore be more evident when the patient looks far away, because the eye cannot abduct."

This results in incomplete lubrication and moisture of the ocular surface, possibly leading to subsequent desiccation and breakdown of the corneal epithelium. During the time that a patient is recovering from a Bell's episode, it is very important to keep the eye constantly lubricated with the use of ophthalmic ointments and gels; in some cases, patching and taping the eyelid closed may be necessary to prevent serious corneal damage. &#10;&#10;Manual of Ocular Diagnosis and Therapy (Sixth edition).

Later, the pupil will eventually become miotic over time. This presentation is thought to be caused by a lesion in the ciliary ganglion or short ciliary nerves, with aberrant regeneration of the ciliary muscle fibers to the iris sphincter. This subsequently leads to a tonic pupil with associated denervation hypersensitivity. &#10;&#10;Diagnostic pharmacologic testing to confirm an Adie's tonic pupil relies on this concept of denervation hypersensitivity. A normal pupil will not constrict to a weak (0.125%) concentration of pilocarpine; however, the abnormal pupil will.

For example, if the right lens is too far from the patient's face, this could be due to the fact that either the right temple is not spread far enough, making that side fit too tightly, or that the left temple is too loose. The opposite is true if the right lens were to be sitting too close to the face. &#10;A simple rule of thumb for frame adjustment is: &#10;-If the right lens is in -> move the right temple in (or left temple out) &#10;-If the left lens is in -> move the left temple in (or right temple out) &#10;-If the right lens is out -> move the right temple out (or left temple in) &#10;-If the left lens is out -> move the left temple out (or right temple in) &#10;&#10;If the frame is not straight on the face, it could be because of incomplete standard alignment, or because one ear of the patient is positioned slightly higher than the other.

Bending the frame so that the optical center no longer passes through the center of rotation of the eye will also induce astigmatism. The induced astigmatism will have the same axis as the axis of rotation, therefore increasing the face wrap will induce astigmatism with an axis of 90 degrees. Increasing the pantoscopic tilt will induce astigmatism with an axis of 180 degrees. The power of the induced astigmatism will have the same sign as the sphere.

      "explanation": "Although there are many ways of inserting ophthalmic lenses into a frame, the most commonly used method is to insert the temporal aspect of the lens first followed by snapping the nasal edge into place from the front of the frame. Most frame materials can be heated, which allows for ease of insertion, but this must be done with caution. Most opticians and clinicians prefer to use a hot air warmer rather than glass beads or sand, allowing for better control of heat distribution and minimizing frame and lens damage. If using sand or glass beads, it is best to use a lower heat setting. Some opticians add baby powder to glass beads to help keep the beads from sticking to the frame, which may cause small bubble-like indentations. When using heat, it is best to remove the temples, thereby decreasing the chances of dislodging or twisting the hinge. Remember that dark-colored frames tend to heat more quickly than light-colored ones. Frames fabricated from polyamide, copolyamide, carbon fiber, carbon fiber graphite or polycarbonate should not be heated."

      "explanation": "The optic nerve can be divided into four segments as it courses from the eye to the optic chiasm. These include the intraocular segment, intraorbital portion, intracanalicular portion, and intracranial region. &#10;&#10;The intraocular segment represents the axons of the photoreceptors as they exit the eye. This is the shortest segment of the nerve, typically measuring 1mm deep and 1.5mm in vertical diameter, and is known as the optic disc or optic nerve head. &#10;&#10;The intraorbital portion of the optic nerve corresponds to the segment that extends from the globe to the optic foramen at the orbital apex. It is about 25 to 30mm in length, and its diameter is significantly larger (3-4mm) due to the addition of the myelin sheaths surrounding the nerve fibers. At the region of the orbital apex, the nerve is surrounded by tough fibrous tissue known as the annulus of Zinn (in which the rectus muscles originate). &#10;&#10;The intracanalicular region of the optic nerve is the segment that traverses the optic canal. It measures about 6mm in length and is fixed to the canal due to fusion of the dura mater with the periosteum. &#10;&#10;The intracranial segment varies in length (averages about 10mm) and is the portion that extends to join the optic chiasm. Fibers that course posteriorly from the optic chiasm are then referred to as the optic tract."

      "explanation": "The physiologic blind spot is a scotoma that can be plotted on a visual field test, which corresponds to the location of the optic nerve head. Because the optic nerve head does not contain any rods or cones, it is blind to all visual information processing. The physiological blind spot is located approximately 15 degrees temporal to fixation and just below the horizontal midline. Anatomically, the optic disc lies nasal to the macula (and just above), but when projected into the visual field, it is located in the opposite direction. The blind spot is elliptical in shape and average 7.5 degrees vertically and 5.5 degrees horizontally, extending about 2 degrees above and 5 degrees below the horizontal midline.&#10;&#10;DeJong's The Neurologic Examination (Seventh edition).

      "options": [" It must increase   ", " It remains the same  ", " It must decrease  "],
      "answers": [" It must increase   "],
      "explanation": "In order to prove that the radius of curvature must increase, use the equation for a single surface power and input any numbers into it. For example, if a lens in air had a power of +4.00 D and an index of refraction of 1.60, it would have a radius of curvature of F = n'-n/r Solve for r: 4.00 = 1.6-1/r; 4.00 = 0.6/r; r = 0.6/4.00 r = 0.15 meters or 15 cm. Therefore, if the index of refraction was to increase to 1.7 and we desired the same power of +4.00 D, the new radius of curvature would have to increase to 17.5 cm. 4.00 = 1.7-1.0/r Solve for r; 4 = 0.7/r; r = 0.7/4; r = 0.175 meters or 17.5 cm."

      "explanation": "An optic pit is a round- or oval-shaped pit that is typically observed at the temporal aspect of the optic disc but can also present centrally in some cases. The optic nerve itself is typically larger than normal, and the pit can be of variable size. Visual acuity remains normal in these patients, as long as there are no associated complications. &#10;&#10;About 45% of patients with a non-central optic disc pit will develop a serous macular detachment during their lifetime (average age is 30 years). The subretinal fluid that leads to the detachment of the outer retinal layers is thought to be derived from the vitreous. There may be associated subretinal deposits present surrounding the macula in these cases, and the appearance may initially be mistaken for central serous retinopathy (CSR). Therefore, it is important to examine the optic disc carefully in patients that present with signs and symptoms of suspected CSR or other causes of macular edema."

      "explanation": "The steps utilized in inserting a lens into a frame during fabrication and adjusting the frame are standard for most plastic frames; however, the major variant is whether or not heat is used during the process (and how much). Some frame materials do not use heat at all when inserting lenses (this is called 'cold snapping') and some materials require high amounts of heat so that the material easily bends with only mild pressure. &#10;Optyl is a frame material that requires high amounts of heat. Heat is typically applied to the frame until it can bend under it's own weight and then lenses can be snapped into the frame, or adjustments to the frame can be made as necessary. Optyl material can safely be heated to temperatures of up to 200 degrees Celsius. &#10;Most other materials utilize only minimal amounts of heat if lenses cannot be 'cold snapped' (cellulose acetate, cellulose proprionate, and carbon fiber). Polycarbonate and polyamide materials should not be heated at all for the lens insertion process as this may lead to lens warpage; therefore, edged lenses must be fabricated exactly to size."

      "answers": [" P=(0.3)(4.25 D)   "],
      "explanation": "For this problem, Prentice's rule is used in order to determine the total prismatic effect. Prentice's rule is expressed as P=(d)(F) where P=prismatic power of the lens, F=the power of the lens in diopters, and d= the distance between the patient's line of sight and the optical center of the lens in centimeters. Prism can be induced when a patient is looking above/below or lateral to the optical centers of a spectacle lens. For the above problem, Prism=(0.3)(4.25 D)= 1.2575 D, or 1.25 D base out prism. &#10;&#10;When dealing with vertical prismatic effects, if the induced prism values over each eye have the same base direction, the prism values are subtracted. If prism values have opposite base directions, then the prism values are added. &#10;&#10;The base direction is dependent on whether the lens is a plus- or minus-powered prescription. Since a plus-powered lens has a greater center thickness, looking above the optical center will induce base down (BD) prism, and looking below the optical center will induce base up prism (BU). A way to visualize this is to picture two prisms stacked together base to base, creating a thick center. Looking temporally from the optical center will create base in (BI) prism while nasal displacement will result in base out (BO) prism. The opposite is true for a minus-powered lens, since the thickness of the lens is greatest at the edge. Looking above the optical center of a minus lens induces BU prism, and looking below the optical center induces BD prism. A minus-powered lens can be visualized as two prisms stacked apex to apex, creating a thin center and thick edge. Looking nasally from the optical center through a minus-powered lens will create base in (BI) prism while temporal displacement will result in base out (BO) prism."

CR-39 blocks 100% of UV-B light but only some of UV-A light. Glass transmits both UV-A and UV-B light to a much greater degree than CR-39 or polycarbonate. Remember to prescribe a UV coating to patients who insist on tinting glass or CR-39 lenses because many patients associate a tint with adequate UV protection."

      "question": "A patient with neurosyphilis causing an Argyll Robertson pupil would be expected to display which of the following results on pupil testing?",
      "options": [
        " Positive pupillary response to near target testing, positive pupillary response to light  ",
        " Positive pupillary response to near target testing, absent or decreased pupillary response to light   ",

      ],
      "answers": [" Positive pupillary response to near target testing, absent or decreased pupillary response to light   "],
      "explanation": "Bilateral Argyll Robertson pupils are a highly specific sign found in patients with neurosyphilis. In these cases, patients typically present with small pupils that do not respond well to light but will exhibit significant constriction when fixation on a near object occurs. This is usually bilateral but may be asymmetrical. This particular finding is also known as 'light-near dissociation.' Argyll Robertson pupil is generally limited to observation in patients with tertiary syphilis; therefore if a patient presents in your office with this finding and does not report a history of syphilis or any other clinical conditions, it is important to refer them for further evaluation and treatment. &#10;&#10;Around the Eye in 365 days.

      "question": "A 52 year-old female presents in your office with a concern that her right pupil appears significantly larger than her left. Upon instillation of 10% cocaine, her right pupil dilates but her left pupil does not. You bring her back the next day and instill 1% hydroxyamphetamine in both eyes, and both pupils dilate.

      "answers": [" Pre-ganglionic sympathetic nerve palsy   "],
      "explanation": "In patients with a suspected damage to the oculosympathetic pathway (Horner's syndrome), cocaine will confirm the diagnosis, while hydroxyamphetamine will differentiate a pre-ganglionic from a post-ganglionic lesion. A summary of pharmacologic testing in Horner's is summarized below. &#10;&#10;10% Cocaine &#10;- The normal pupil will dilate but the abnormal pupil will not &#10;- The rationale for this is that in a normal pupil, norepinephrine is released from the post-ganglionic sympathetic nerve endings and is eventually re-absorbed, terminating the nerve impulse &#10;- Cocaine inhibits the re-uptake of norepinephrine, allowing it to accumulate in the synapse and causing dilation of the pupil &#10;- In Horner's syndrome, the abnormal eye will not produce any norepinephrine in the first place, so cocaine has no effect on the pupil size &#10;&#10;1% Hydroxyamphetamine &#10;- In a pre-ganglionic lesion, both pupils dilate &#10;- In a post-ganglionic lesion, the abnormal pupil will not dilate &#10;- The rationale for this is that hydroxyamphetamine will stimulate the release of norepinephrine from the post-ganglionic neurons &#10;- If there is damage to a pre-ganglionic neuron (leaving the post-ganglionic intact), norepinephrine will be released and dilation will occur &#10;- If there is damage to the post-ganglionic neuron, hydroxyamphetamine will have no effect on this neuron, no norepinephrine will be released, and the pupil will not dilate"

      "question": "A patient is seen at your office complaining that her right eye is physiologically higher than her left eye. She would like to know if glasses would help improve the cosmesis of her predicament. You know that prism will shift the image of an object. How would you orient a prism to help her appearance?",

      "answers": [" Prescribe base up prism over the right eye   "],
      "explanation": "A prism will bend light towards its base, but the image will be shifted towards the apex of the prism. Therefore, by prescribing base up prism over her right eye, its image will be shifted down towards the apex of the prism. Another way of remembering this is to think of the prism as an arrow that will point in the direction of the deviation (i.e., exotropia is neutralized with base in prism, the eye points outwards, the apex of the prism also points out). Prescribing prism for cosmetic purposes may not always be an option as significant vertical prism may induce diplopia or visual discomfort."

      "question": "A patient with 4.50 D of hyperopia wishes to purchase glasses. Which of the following can be performed to minimize the amount of spherical aberration experienced by the patient when he is looking through his glasses?",
      "options": [
        " Prescribing a plano-convex lens with the convex side of the lens placed inwards (the convex side should be the F2 surface)  ",
        " Maintain a single and uniform radius of curvature throughout the lens  ",
        " Prescribe a biconvex lens and ensure that the smallest blank size is utilized placing the bevel towards the front of the lens  ",
        " Ensure that the prescribed lens is steeper towards the center and flatter peripherally  "
      ],
      "answers": [" Ensure that the prescribed lens is steeper towards the center and flatter peripherally  "],
      "explanation": "Spherical aberration occurs when parallel light rays incident on the cornea and lens that are located further away from the visual axis are bent to a greater degree than axial rays, resulting in an image that comes to a point focus in front of the retinal plane. Spherical lenses (both plus- and minus-powered) result in positive spherical aberration; thus rays of light that are located towards the lens periphery (nonparaxial) are bent more than those that intersect the center of the lens (paraxial rays). Spherical aberration can be minimized by prescribing an aspheric lens for higher powered prescriptions. Aspheric lenses have multiple radii of curvature. A plus powered aspheric lens has a radius of curvature that increases towards the periphery of the lens (the periphery of the lens is flatter than the center). Studies have shown that plano-convex lenses produce smaller amounts of spherical aberration. For hyperopes, a plano-convex lens should be placed with its convex side as the F1 to decrease spherical aberration. Spherical aberration can also be minimized by decreasing the size of the aperture/pupil. Biconvex lenses should not be prescribed as this lens results in more spherical aberration than a plano-convex lens."

      "explanation": "The Abbe number is the reciprocal of the dispersion of a spectacle lens. As the dispersion increases, a patient might experience seeing a rainbow of color as they view in the lens periphery. This is known as chromatic aberration. Crown glass has a high Abbe number of 59 and thus a low chromatic aberration."

      "answers": [" R= (1.33-1.0)2/(1.33+1.0)2   "],
      "explanation": "Fresnel's law of reflectance states that some amount of light is reflected at each surface, which then decreases the amount of transmitted light. The equation is as follows: R = (n2-n1)2/(n2+n1)2 , where R= reflectance (assuming normal incidence), n2= the index of the second medium, and n1= the index of the first medium. Solve for R= (1.33-1.0)2/(1.33+1.0)2, R= (0.1089)/(5.43)=0.020 or 2%. This finding is important for ophthalmic lenses, especially those of higher index which reflect more light. Makers of optical devices can minimize reflectance by adding anti-reflective coatings."

      "answers": [" Round 28 bifocal   "],
      "explanation": "Image jump is the phenomenon where the patient's eyes are passing from the distance prescription and are now viewing just below the top of the bifocal segment. The eyes are not quite at the near optical center (OC), therefore prism is induced. The farther away the near OC is from the top of the segment, the larger the amount of image jump. The round 28 bifocal has its optical center 14 mm below the top of the segment (the optical center for a round segment is located at its center, which is half of its diameter). The flat top 28 and flat top 35 bifocal optical centers are located 5 mm below the segment line. The Executive OC is on the segment line, so no image jump is created."

      "answers": [" Hot water   "],
      "explanation": "The preferred method utilized for heating nylon frames is hot water. Nylon frames cannot be heated uniformly enough through other methods as hot forced air and salt pans do not penetrate the material enough, leaving the outer layers hot and the deeper portions too cool to stretch or bend. Hot water tends to penetrate the nylon material best. When adjusting a nylon frame, it is best to hold the frame into its desired position as it cools. If the frame is released before it cools, it tends to resume its initial conformation. The addition of cold running water can help speed the process along."

      "answers": [" The minus power of the spectacle lenses must be increased   "],
      "explanation": "When a minus powered lens (greater than 4.00 D) is moved from the corneal to the spectacle plane, the power needs to be adjusted by adding more minus to ensure a clear retinal image. Logically, the far point of the eye must correspond with the secondary focal point of the lens to achieve a clear retinal image. The far point of a myopic eye is an unchanging fixed distance from the eye. Spectacles are further from the eye but closer to the far point of the eye (by the vertex distance of the spectacle) and therefore a higher power will achieve a reduced focal length, which makes sense, as the lens is physically closer to the far point of the eye. Contact lenses sit closer to the eye and further from the actual far point of the eye and therefore require less minus power at the corneal plane. Therefore, to ensure that the far point of the eye coincides with the secondary focal point of the lens, the power of the contact lens must be decreased for a myopic eye when going from the spectacle to the corneal plane."

      "explanation": "A concave-meniscus lens has a surface that is concave (negative power) and a surface that is convex (plus power). With this type of lens, the power of the concave surface is greater than the convex, leading to a negative overall power. If the convex surface had a greater power, this would be considered a convex-meniscus lens. &#10;&#10;Concave-meniscus lenses also have thicker edges compared to their center thickness (convex-meniscus lenses are thicker in the center)."

      "answers": [" Corneal asphericity   "],
      "explanation": "Spherical aberration (SA) occurs when parallel light rays incident on the cornea and lens that are located further away from the visual axis are bent to a greater degree than axial rays, resulting in an image that comes to a point focus in front of the retinal plane. Because the cornea is steepest centrally and flattens towards the periphery, this asphericity offsets some of the positive spherical aberration experienced by the eye. A larger pupil results in more spherical aberration. Accommodation decreases the amount of spherical aberration, while an unaccommodated eye generally possesses increased positive spherical aberration; this explains why SA tends to increase with age as we lose our ability to accommodate."

      "question": "An object in air is located 40 cm to the left of a +4.25 D spherical CR39 plastic surface (n=1.498). In order to solve for the distance of the resultant image from the apex of the surface, which of the following must be calculated FIRST?",
      "options": [" The radius of curvature  ", " The index of the surrounding medium  ", " The object location from the refracting surface  ", " The image vergence at the refracting surface  ", " The object vergence at the refracting surface   "],
      "answers": [" The object vergence at the refracting surface   "],
      "explanation": "In order to solve for the distance of the image from the refracting surface, the object vergence must be calculated. In the above problem, this is solved as follows: L=n/l where L= the object vergence, n=the index of the medium containing the object, and l=the distance of the light rays from the object to the refracting surface in meters. L= 1.0/-0.4= -2.5. The paraxial relationship deems that the vergence of light rays forming an image is the combination of incident vergence and the power of the refracting surface. One can now determine that the vergence of the incident light on a +4.25D plastic surface is -2.50. Adding the two values together yields the power of the image vergence L'=L+P where L= the object vergence and P= the power of the refracting surface, which in this case is -2.50 +4.25 = +1.75 D. Because the light rays forming the image are converging, the image is real. The location of the image is calculated using the formula L'=n'/l' where L= the image vergence, n'= the index of the medium in which the light rays form an image, and l'= the distance between the refracting surface and the image. We have already determined that L'= +1.75 D and n'= 1.498. Solving for l', +1.75=1.498/l', l'= 0.856 or 85.6 cm to the right of the refracting surface."

      "answers": [" The segment height of the right eye should be raised   "],
      "explanation": "Because the prism will shift the image towards the apex, the patient's eye will be looking slightly up at the image. In order to ensure that the pupils view through the segments at the same time, one must raise the bifocal height of the right eye. Make sure that you inform the patient that their seg heights will be unequal so there are no surprises when they pick up their glasses! A good rule of thumb to follow is that the segment height must be altered by 0.3 mm for every diopter of vertical prism added to one eye only (if the prism is distributed fairly equally between the eyes, then there is no need to adjust the bifocal height). Remember that for base down prism you must raise the seg height and for base up prism you must lower the seg height.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Measuring Multifocal Heights"

The etiology of optic neuritis is presumed to be demyelination of the optic nerve, most commonly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS); however, it can be an acute idiopathic disease. Studies on optic neuritis have also shown that patients in whom optic neuritis occurs as an isolated phenomenon have a higher risk of developing multiple sclerosis in the future. Therefore, there is a strong association with the occurrence of optic neuritis in patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and for those in which MS is not present, there is a high chance they will eventually develop the disease."

      "explanation": "The third nerve fasciculus is composed of efferent fibers that pass from the nuclear complex, through the red nucleus and medial region of the cerebral peduncle. These fibers then emerge from the midbrain and traverse into the interpeduncular space. The most common causes of fascicular lesions are vascular disease, primary tumors, metastasis, and demyelination. There are several syndromes that may occur, depending on the location of the lesion, along the course of the fascicular fibers. These include Benedikt syndrome, Weber syndrome, Nothnagel syndrome, and Claude syndrome. Wall-eyed bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (WEBINO) occurs as a result of a lesion involving the paired medial rectus subnuclei of the third nerve. &#10;&#10;Benedikt syndrome involves the fasciculus as the fibers pass through the red nucleus. Patients will develop an ipsilateral third nerve palsy with contralateral extrapyramidal signs (such as hemitremor). &#10;&#10;Weber syndrome involves the fascicular fibers as they pass through the cerebral peduncle. Signs include ipsilateral third nerve palsy with contralateral hemiparesis. &#10;&#10;Nothnagel syndrome involves the superior cerebral peduncle and the fasciculus.

      "explanation": "When heating frames in a salt pan, the frame should be moved very slowly and continually while under the salt in order to avoid pitting of the frames with salt granules. If after pulling the frame out of the salt, the salt sticks to a dry frame, additional talcum powder should be added to the salt pan. The only two components of the salt pan are the salt and talcum powder. The salt conveys heat well and the talcum powder is added in order to prevent the salt from clumping together and sticking to the frame."

      "explanation": "Horner's syndrome results in anisocoria that is greater in dim illumination. The affected pupil is smaller and dilates less than the normal (larger) pupil in the dark. A triad of miosis, ipsilateral mild ptosis (1-2mm), and ipsilateral anhidrosis can be associated with Horner's syndrome. Other signs include lower intraocular pressure (1-2 mmHg) and lower lid elevation in the affected eye. Iris heterochromia is an indication of congenital Horner's syndrome. &#10;&#10;The cocaine test is used to confirm the diagnosis of Horner's syndrome. Topical cocaine 4-10% is instilled in both eyes and pupils are checked after 30-60 minutes. If both pupils dilate equally, then normal physiologic anisocoria is present. However, if the smaller pupil dilates poorly in comparison to the normal (larger) pupil, the diagnosis of Horner's syndrome is confirmed. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, hydroxyamphetamine 1% can be used to localize the cause and distinguish between preganglionic and postganglionic lesions."

      "explanation": "Image jump is based on the add power and the near optical center location and does not involve the distance Rx. As the person looks down into the segment to read, their eyes pass from the distance Rx into the bifocal segment. At that point they experience 'jump', since the eyes are not looking through the near optical center. Vertical prism is thus induced, causing the 'jump' effect. Using Prentice's rule, Prism = F x d(cm) where the power (F) is the add power and the distance (d) is determined by how far away the near optical center is from the top of the segment; i.e., prism = 2.00 x 0.5 or 1 prism diopter. Remember, for a flat top 28 bifocal, the optical center is located 5 mm below the segment line. &#10;&#10;The add is a plus lens. Draw a plus lens in the segment so that the bases of the plus lens are coincident with the near optical center. If the patient's eyes are just passing through the top of the segment, base down prism is induced."

Unless specified, assume the reading level is 10 mm below the distance optical centers. Using Prentice's rule, calculate the reverse slab-off amount. The total vertical power of the right lens is calculated using the F=sphere + cylinder (sine2 theta) equation.

      "explanation": "The first cross represents the base curve on the front of the lens. The second curve represents the back or ocular curve. The third cross represents the final Rx. Place the Rx on the third of the 3 optical crosses. The vertical cross is +2.00; the horizontal cross is -2.00. Now fill in the second cross with the values given in the question, namely -4.00 on the vertical cross and -8.00 on the horizontal cross. Adding the vertical meridians of cross number 1 added to the vertical meridians of cross number 2 should equal the vertical meridian value of cross number 3. Repeat for the horizontal meridians of each cross. Base curves for modern lenses should always have a plus value. &#10;&#10;The equation should resemble something like this: &#10;&#10;&#10;? -4.00 +2.00 &#10;l l l &#10;l l l &#10;? --------- + -8.00 --------- = -2.00 ---------- &#10;l l l &#10;l l l &#10;&#10;So to get the base curve of the front of the lens simply determine what number in the vertical meridian added to -4 will result in a power of +2. x +-4 = +2. &#10;Solve for x, the answer is +6.00. Now do the same in the horizontal meridian. &#10;x + -8 = -2. Solve for x. Again the answer is +6. Therefore, the base curve is +6.00."

The amount of astigmatism is found by determining the total difference between the two meridians and assigning a minus sign to the determined value. From the above image, the least myopic meridian or most plus meridian is +1.25, and its associated axis is 098. The amount of astigmatism is -5.00; this is found by calculating the difference between the meridians as follows: +1.25-(-3.75) = +5.00 and then assigning a minus sign to the value, since the result needs to be in minus-cylinder format."

      "answers": [" 1% Atropine   "],
      "explanation": "Atropine is a useful ophthalmic drop that is available in 0.5%, 1% and 2% concentrations. Its cycloplegic effect can last for as long as 12 days. It is commonly utilized for cycloplegic refractions in children, treatment of uveitis, amblyopia, and to test for glaucoma by inducing acute angle-closure glaucoma (verifies if angles are open). Its ocular side effects include irritation, contact dermatitis, elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP), and angle-closure glaucoma. Atropine is contraindicated in people who have narrow angle glaucoma and open angle glaucoma because it can cause an increase in IOP. Atropine should also not be used in children with Down's syndrome because it leads to a hyper-sensitive reaction where the extent of the mydriasis is greater than that of normals. Although some articles currently exist that refute the argument that atropine is not safe to use in people with Down's syndrome, it is ALWAYS best to exercise caution in the best interests of the patient. There are many other cycloplegic agents that can be used as alternatives without posing a risk to patients with Trisomy 21. Bear in mind that homatropine and scopolamine carry the same contraindications as atropine."

This observed difference is particularly true in individuals with darkly pigmented skin and dark irides. Patients with lighter-colored irides also recover from the effects of cycloplegia at a faster rate than patients with dark irides.

      "explanation": "The amount of chloroquine that is usually required to produce retinal toxicity is a total cumulative dosage of 460 grams. Symptoms of chloroquine toxicity typically involve decreased vision, abnormal color vision, and difficulty dark-adapting. Retinal evaluation commonly reveals a bull's-eye appearance of the macula in which there is a ring of depigmentation surrounded by a ring of increased pigmentation. Foveal reflex is also diminished in patients presenting with this condition. &#10;&#10;It is also possible to develop retinal toxicity as a result of hydroxychloroquine use, but this is much less common than with chloroquine. Typically, more than 400 mg/day taken over a period of months to years, or a cumulative dose of 1,000 grams, is required to produce clinical signs and symptoms."

      "options": [" 6 months  ", " 1 hour  ", " 1 month   ", " 3 months  ", " 1 day  "],
      "answers": [" 1 month   "],
      "explanation": "Corticosteroid-induced glaucoma was first described in 1950 when a study of steroid use and subsequent IOP elevation showed that 18-36% of healthy individuals and 46-92% of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma 'responded' with an elevation of IOP over a course of 2-4 weeks. Other studies have also agreed that the average time it takes for a corticosteroid to cause an increase in IOP is close to 4 weeks as well. However, if the corticosteroid being utilized is of high potency, or is used at a very frequent rate, the rise in IOP can present sooner. In some cases, the rise in IOP can also be delayed for years. Thus, patients undergoing any steroid treatment must be examined on a regular basis."

      "explanation": "Doubling the dosage of a drug serves only to add one half-life to its duration of action and therefore does not actually double its duration of therapeutic response. The therapeutic index of a drug is defined as TI=LD50/ED50. Thus, the higher the lethal dose and the lower the effective dose, the higher the therapeutic index. A high therapeutic index ensures a lower mortality rate and higher safety of the drug. In order to have a high clinical margin of safety, one desires a large difference between the ratio of the lethal dose to 1% of the population to the effective dose to 99% of the population."

      "explanation": "A zero-order rate of elimination will result in a drug being eliminated at a constant rate. A zero-order process is independent of the concentration of the drug; therefore, increasing the amount of the drug will not result in a greater amount of the drug being eliminated. In comparison, a first-order rate of elimination is largely dependent on the concentration of the drug. Increasing the amount or dose of the substance will result in a greater amount of drug elimination. Second-order and third-order rates of elimination do not exist in pharmacokinetics."

      "explanation": "Isotretinoin, birth control pills, and diuretics, among many other drugs, can cause myopia in some patients. Myopia most likely results from corneal swelling, which steepens the curvature of the cornea. Drugs that cause swelling of the lens, accommodative spasm, or edema of the ciliary body will also result in myopia. A reduction in the dose of the medication or cessation of the offending drug will usually result in reversal of nearsightedness. Fish oil, Tylenol®, and Tums® have not been shown to have a correlation with transient myopia development."

      "explanation": "Tylenol® is an oral analgesic that works well for mild to moderate and acute or chronic pain without inhibiting platelet aggregation. Tylenol® is metabolized by the liver and excreted by the kidneys and therefore should not be recommended to people who suffer from liver impairment or chronic alcoholism. Aspirin is also a mild oral analgesic; however, unlike Tylenol®, it can prolong bleeding time as it interferes with platelet aggregation. Aspirin is contraindicated in people who suffer from upper gastrointestinal (GI) disease, asthma, nasal polyps, bleeding disorders or have chronic renal or hepatic disease. Motrin® and Naprosyn® are classified as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and also work very well for mild to moderate pain relief. NSAIDS may cause GI irritation, mild inhibition of platelet aggregation, and kidney damage. Any of the above drugs can cause liver problems if used inappropriately; however, because it is primarily metabolized by the liver, Tylenol® does have a greater propensity to cause liver damage."

      "explanation": "Bronchial asthma and Down's syndrome are not relative contraindications of phenylephrine when applied to the ocular surface. Phenylephrine is a sympathomimetic, and, as such, it can affect the heart rate and blood pressure. Although rare, phenylephrine can cause tachycardia, arrhythmia, syncope, and an increase in blood pressure. A rapid increase in blood pressure has also been seen in people who suffer from idiopathic orthostatic hypotension. Note that the above ailments are relative contraindications; therefore, one must exercise caution when using phenylephrine. Be sure to monitor blood pressure in geriatric patients who suffer from cardiac disease.

      "answers": [" Alcohol   "],
      "explanation": "Excessive amounts of alcohol intake can result in nystagmus. Law enforcement officers take advantage of this knowledge to test for sobriety. Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant, and excessive amounts can lead to cognitive and motor impairment. Alcohol is metabolized by the liver, which is capable of processing roughly 0.5 ounce of ethanol per hour (depending on height, weight, food intake etc.). The effects of alcohol on the brain are not uniform. The first area of the brain to be affected is the outer cerebral hemispheres, followed by the limbic system, and lastly, the brainstem (which is comprised of the midbrain, pons, and medulla). Areas of the brain are affected at different rates; this explains why systems that regulate some functions (i.e. emotions) become deficient before others (heart rate and blood pressure). Alcohol causes impairment of smooth pursuits and saccades. Lithium can cause linear waveform jerk nystagmus. Benadryl is sometimes used to treat vertigo, which can also be associated with nystagmus."

      "options": [" Alpha 2 adrenergic agents  ", " Prostaglandin analogs  ", " Beta-blockers   ", " Cholinergic agents  "],
      "answers": [" Beta-blockers   "],
      "explanation": "Beta-blockers have a potential to decrease the heart rate. It is important to obtain baseline information for both heart rate and blood pressure to compare during subsequent follow-up with patients using beta-blocker medications. Beta-blockers taken as topical medications for eye-related issues may drain through the nasolacrimal duct and become absorbed by the nasal mucosa entering the blood stream. This process bypasses first pass metabolism and thus parallels obtaining the drug intravenously; this may have a significant effect on the patient's heart rate."

      "options": [" Amoxicillin  ", " Erythromycin   ", " Tobramycin  ", " Tetracycline  "],
      "answers": [" Erythromycin   "],
      "explanation": "Erythromycin and azithromycin belong to a class of drugs called macrolides. Macrolides are effective antibiotics because they bind to the 50S subunit of bacterial ribosomes, thus interfering with bacterial protein synthesis. Tetracycline and doxycycline are classified as tetracyclines. This class of drugs also interferes with protein synthesis via binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Amoxicillin, Augmentin®, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin are common anti-bacterials belonging to a class of drugs termed penicillins. Penicillins disrupt cell wall synthesis, making them valuable and commonly used antibiotics. Tobramycin, gentamicin and neomycin are categorized as aminoglycosides, which serve as antimicrobials via two mechanisms. Aminoglycosides inhibit bacterial protein synthesis as well as they cause the creation of openings in bacterial cell membranes, allowing for increased antibiotic uptake.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Antibacterial Agents"

      "explanation": "COX-1 and COX-2 are isoenzymes that serve a key role in the formation of prostaglandins, and to a lesser extent, thromboxane from arachidonic acid. Prostaglandins chemically signal pain and cause inflammation. Blockage of these enzymes results in a decrease in prostaglandin synthesis, leading to a reduction of both pain and swelling. Nociceptors are receptors in the body that signal pain. NSAIDs do not alter these receptors and therefore do not serve to decrease pain via this mechanism.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Topical NSAIDs"

      "explanation": "Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a severe mucocutaneous skin condition in which the epidermis layer of the skin separates from the dermis. This disease is thought to be caused by a hypersensitive response to certain systemic drugs, most notably antibiotics, but may also occur following an infection. In some cases, it is believed that a genetic predisposition can put certain individuals at a higher risk for development of this condition as well. However, in up to 50% of cases the precipitating cause of Stevens-Johnson syndrome remains unknown because symptoms can often take close to 3 weeks to develop after exposure."

      "answers": [" Diuretics   "],
      "explanation": "The choice of initial treatment of hypertension is complex and depends on co-morbidities. ACE and ARBs are the current preference. ACE inhibitors are available generically and thus are cheaper, but increasingly ARBs (notably Cozaar® (losartan)) are being made available generically. Calcium channel blockers are popular but less so than ACE and ARB, which work on the Renin system. The finding of transient myopia, while not common, is not altogether rare and should always be considered in patients on thiazide diuretics."

      ],
      "answers": [" Antagonism of beta receptors, causing decreased heart rate and relaxation of vascular tone   "],
      "explanation": "Beta blockers serve to decrease blood pressure by blocking the effects of catecholamines (such as epinephrine), thereby allowing for diminished cardiac output and decreased peripheral resistance (attributable to vasodilation). A marked reduction in renin released by the kidneys helps to lower blood pressure by decreasing amounts of circulating angiotensin II, which is a powerful vasoconstrictor. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I into angiotensin II; therefore, drugs that inhibit ACE help to lower blood pressure.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Blood Pressure"

      "options": [" Antazoline phosphate  ", " Naphazoline hydrochloride (HCL)   ", " Pheniramine maleate  ", " Olopatadine  "],
      "answers": [" Naphazoline hydrochloride (HCL)   "],
      "explanation": "Naphazoline HCL is most frequently utilized in over-the-counter formulas as a decongestant. Naphazoline is an alpha-1 agonist that causes vasoconstriction of the conjunctival vasculature. Common topical antihistamine/decongestants are: Vasocon-A®, Naphcon-A,® AK-Con-A® and Opcon-A®. In general, these preparations are good for transient itching, hyperemia, chemosis, lid swelling, and tearing. However, long-term use can lead to rebound hyperemia and follicular conjunctivitis. Therefore, if a patient suffers from chronic allergic conjunctivitis, it is best to prescribe a medication that provides more long-term relief with minimal side effects. Antazoline phosphate and pheniramine maleate are first-generation topical antihistamines that are contained in Vasocon-A® (antazoline) and Naphcon-A®, AK-Con-A®, and Opcon-A® (all contain pheniramine). Olopatadine (Patanol®) is a second-generation topical antihistamine/mast cell inhibitor."

      "answers": [" Anterior uveitis   ", " Posterior synechiae   ", " Amblyopia   "],
      "explanation": "Atropine is a parasympatholytic drug. Administration of atropine may result in glaucoma in narrow-angle patients because it causes pupil dilation that leads to blockage of the trabecular meshwork, causing a spike in intraocular pressure. Because atropine causes cycloplegia, it can be used in the management of amblyopia, as it forces the child to utilize their weaker eye, hopefully serving to strengthen and increase the visual acuity of that eye. Due to the fact that atropine results in pupil dilation, it is often used in the treatment of anterior uveitis to help prevent formation or promote breakdown of synechiae. It also aids in pain management by controlling pupil size and avoiding unnecessary movement of the iris muscles, which can be very painful in this inflammatory condition."

      "explanation": "Fluticasone is a synthetic corticosteroid that has a very potent anti-inflammatory action. Inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma; therefore, this anti-inflammatory is very effective in helping to control asthmatic complications. As is the case with all other steroids, patients using Advair® should be examined periodically to monitor intraocular pressure and possible development of cataracts. &#10;&#10;Salmeterol is a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist. Beta2-adrenoceptors are the predominant adrenergic receptors involved in bronchial smooth muscle, with little association to the heart. Salmeterol acts to increase the levels of circulating cyclic AMP in the bloodstream; this causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of the release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells (especially mast cells).&#10;PowerPage&#10;Asthma"

      "explanation": "Edrophonium (sold under trade names Tensilon® and Enlon®) is the most commonly used pharmacologic agent in the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Edrophonium is an anticholinesterase agent, which acts by inactivating the acetylcholinesterase enzyme and thereby allowing an accumulation of acetylcholine (ACh) in the neuromuscular junction. These raised amounts of ACh result in prolonged neurotransmitter activity due to an increased likelihood of ACh working on the postsynaptic receptors at the neuromuscular junction. This activity results in improvement in the appearance of eyelid ptosis and/or ocular misalignment. Edrophonium has a relatively fast onset (30-60 seconds) and short duration of action (10 minutes). Keep in mind that edrophonium is injected intravenously and can be very dangerous in a patient with cardiac or respiratory diseases."

      "answers": [" Betoptic® (betaxolol)   "],
      "explanation": "Betoptic® is considered cardioselective. Beta-1 and Beta-2 are the two predominant types of beta-adrenergic receptors. Beta-1 receptors are located primarily in the heart. Beta-2 receptors are located on other tissues such as blood vessels, muscles, and tissue that lines the airway. Cardioselective beta blockers (Betoptic® and Optipranolol®) have a high affinity for binding to beta-1 receptors. These agents cause a decrease in heart rate and a reduction in the force of its contraction, thereby decreasing blood pressure. Non-cardioselective beta blockers (Betagan®, Timoptic® and Ocupress®) bind to both types of beta receptors and do not have as much of an effect on the heart but can affect the airways by causing constriction. It is therefore recommmended that they not be used in people with bronchial asthma. Beta-blockers help to decrease intraocular pressure by decreasing aqueous production; this is accomplished by blocking beta-2 receptors located on the ciliary body."

Beta-blockers serve to decrease intraocular pressure (IOP) by blocking respective beta receptors located in the ciliary body, thereby decreasing production of aqueous. Beta blockers also decrease the damaging effects of glaucoma by increasing outflow facility, resulting in a lowering of IOP. Note: beta blockers generally end in 'olol'."

      "answers": [" Inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV   "],
      "explanation": "Fluoroquinolones, such as Vigamox® and Zymar®, are effective antibacterial agents because they inhibit DNA gyrase and topoisomerase, and therefore ultimately inhibit bacterial DNA synthesis. Penicillin-based drugs inhibit cell wall synthesis. &#10;&#10;Aminoglycosides, such as tobramycin, interfere with protein synthesis by binding to bacterial ribosomes. Vancomycin disrupts cell wall synthesis by binding to pentapeptides, thereby inhibiting elongation of peptidoglycan, which is necessary for cell wall synthesis."

      "explanation": "Aspirin has been linked with Reye's syndrome. Reye's syndrome is a very rare condition that affects all of the body organs; however, it is most destructive to the brain and liver. Reye's syndrome is almost always associated with a previous viral infection. Although Reye's syndrome can occur without Aspirin use, studies have demonstrated an increase in the incidence of this condition and the consumption of aspirin. Aspirin has not been known to suppress bone growth. It is noteworthy that Aspirin use decreases the chance of heart attack and stroke. A correlation between perifoveal telangiectasia and aspirin does not exist."

      "answers": [" Stroma   "],
      "explanation": "For topical ocular lipophilic drugs, the major rate-limiting barrier providing the greatest resistance to penetration is the corneal stroma. The stromal layers of the cornea have a high aqueous content (90% water) and are therefore more hydrophilic in nature. It is this layer that accounts for about 50% of the total corneal penetration resistance to lipophilic topical medications. &#10;&#10;In the case of hydrophilic drugs, the lipoidal corneal epithelium is the major barrier. In order to combat these properties of the cornea, drug companies strive to produce drugs that have both some lipophilic and hydrophilic properties. &#10;&#10;Ocular Periphery and Disorders.

      "options": [" Canthaxanthin  ", " Chloroquine  ", " Thioridazine   ", " Tamoxifen  ", " Hydroxychloroquine  "],
      "answers": [" Thioridazine   "],
      "explanation": "Thioridazine is a systemic medication belonging to the phenothiazines class that is used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia and related psychosis. Typical daily doses of thioridazine are in the range of 150-600mg; however, in some patients, doses in excess of 800mg/day are necessary. In these cases, this may be sufficient to cause a reduction in best-corrected visual acuity, diminished dark adaptation, and the development of retinopathy. Retinal changes associated with thioridazine toxicity begin as salt-and-pepper pigmentary changes that become apparent in the mid-peripheral retinal and posterior pole. Eventually, plaque-like pigment clumps will form, with focal loss of the RPE and choriocapillaris, that may progress to diffuse atrophy. &#10;&#10;Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are systemic medications that also may produce retinal toxicity. The classic signs of retinopathy in these cases involves a 'bulls-eye' macular lesion that presents as a central island of pigment, surrounded by a hypopigmented zone of RPE atrophy, which is also encircled by another area of hyperpigmentation. &#10;&#10;Tamoxifen and canthaxanthin produce crystalline maculopathies, in which crystalline material is deposited in the inner layers of the retina."

      "answers": [" Rebound hyperemia   "],
      "explanation": "Ocular decongestants are widely available in over-the-counter preparations and serve to decrease conjunctival hyperemia. Decongestants result in the appearance of a 'whiter eye' via stimulation of alpha-1 receptors of the conjunctival vasculature causing vasoconstriction. Several ocular decongestants exist, including naphazoline, tetrahydrozoline, oxymetazoline, and phenylephrine, all of which are alpha-1 agonists. Ocular decongestants may cause stinging, pupillary dilation, rebound congestion, conjunctival hyperemia, and upper lid retraction; these side effects are most marked with phenylephrine. Note: Visine's® active ingredient is tetrahydrozoline. Caution: because there is a risk of pupil dilation, do not use in patients with narrow angles. Because ocular decongestants are adrenergic agonists, it is important that these products be used with caution in people with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, and diabetes due to the fact that, although extremely rare, usage can lead to a worsening of these conditions."

      "explanation": "Chloramphenicol should only be utilized in the presence of a severe infection that is not responsive to any other agent. Chloramphenicol is very lipid-soluble and easily crosses the blood-aqueous barrier; as such, it can cause bone marrow depression (which is reversible), aplastic anemia, gray baby syndrome (occurs if chloramphenicol is given within 2 weeks of birth), optic neuropathy, teratogenesis, and enterocolitis. Due to chloramphenicol's ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, it is useful in treating staphylococcal brain abscesses and certain types of meningitis."

      "answers": [" Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2)   "],
      "explanation": "Hydrogen Peroxide (3%) is a very useful antiseptic and disinfectant. It is also bactericidal and virucidal. Mercurials such as thimerosal are very toxic and only mildly bacteriostatic. Chlorhexidine disrupts the bacterial cell membrane and is useful for the prevention of dental cavities but does not possess virucidal properties. BAK is very commonly used in ophthalmic drop preparations as a preservative. It denatures bacterial cell membranes and therefore, depending on its concentration, can be used as a bacteriostatic agent (low concentrations) or bactericidal or fungicidal agent (high concentrations), but it is not virucidal. It should be noted that the effectiveness of BAK is diminished by soap, blood, and cotton. Because particles of HIV can be found in tears, it is important to disinfect Goldmann tonometer tips. Studies have shown that disinfecting a tonometer tip with 3% H2O2 is effective for HIV and Herpes simplex I and II."

      "answers": [" Benzalkonium chloride (BAK)   "],
      "explanation": "BAK is frequently used in many topical antibacterial agents. With continual use, BAK can damage the lipid layer and lead to increased epithelial permeability. The corneal epithelium acts as a natural barrier against pathogens; when the epithelium becomes compromised, there is a greater risk of infection. Be careful when treating ocular infections with BAK as prolonged use can lead to corneal toxicity. &#10;&#10;All of the other options are also frequently used as preservatives in artificial tear preparations; however, BAK poses the greatest risk for corneal toxicity. &#10;&#10;Polyquad is a good preservative (especially for contact lens solutions) as it possesses a high molecular weight and will not soak into contact lenses. &#10;&#10;Chlorobutanol is used in some gas-permeable contact lens solutions. It is both antibacterial and antifungal but not very effective and tends to dissipate during long periods of storage. Chlorobutanol has a low risk of toxicity. &#10;&#10;Methylparaben is commonly found as a preservative in cosmetic and food preservatives. It has a very low risk of corneal toxicity. &#10;&#10;Sodium perborate undergoes several chemical reactions once in contact with the eye. It is converted from hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen on the eye and thus has a very low change of cellular toxicity. &#10;&#10;Reference: Bartlett, J. and Jaanus, S.

      "answers": [" Alphagan-P® (brimonidine tartrate)   "],
      "explanation": "Alphagan-P® would be the best choice, as her medical and ocular history offers no contraindications for this medication. Pilocarpine is not an option as she has suffered a previous retinal detachment, and pilocarpine use can increase the risk of retinal detachment. Timoptic® is ruled out because her medical history is significant for asthma; Timoptic® can cause constriction of the airway. Cosopt® is a mixture of dorzolamide and timolol. Dorzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and contains a sulfa group in its chemical formula. Our patient is allergic to sulfa medications, therefore Cosopt® is contraindicated. Travatan-Z® should not be considered because the patient's ocular history is remarkable for uveitis.

      "explanation": "Most drugs utilized to treat depression increase levels of serotonin and norepinephrine by blocking reuptake of these neurotransmitters or by down regulation of beta receptors. &#10;&#10;Monoamine oxidase is an enzyme that causes catabolism of norepinephrine and serotonin; therefore, inhibition of monoamine oxidase results in a decrease of symptoms associated with depression. &#10;&#10;Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter used by both the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system as a neuromodulator. Acetylcholine has many target sites in the body; some studies have shown it has a minor role in depression. In such an instance, increased levels of acetylcholine can be conducive to treatment of depression. &#10;&#10;Although the extent of dopamine's role in depression is unclear, increased levels of dopamine are thought to be beneficial in the treatment of depression."

      "options": [" Deferoxamine  ", " British anti-lewisite (BAL)  ", " Zinc  ", " Ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA)   "],
      "answers": [" Ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA)   "],
      "explanation": "Band keratopathy is characterized by a band-like deposition of calcium in the central portion of the cornea. Removal of calcium requires the use of a topical anesthetic followed by the application of EDTA. EDTA chelates calcium, enabling large plaques of calcium to be scraped off the cornea. BAL, also known as dimercaprol, can be used ophthalmically to prevent corneal damage from arsenic compounds. BAL was initially developed during the war as an antidote to exposure to lewisite, an arsenic-based chemical warfare agent. BAL can be used for the chelation of heavy metals such as nickel, gold, and mercury. Deferoxamine binds to iron and can be utilized to remove corneal rust rings. Zinc is not a chelating agent."

      "explanation": "Brimonidine (Alphagan®) belongs to the alpha-2 agonist class of glaucoma medications. In addition to its effect of lowering intraocular pressure (IOP), studies have shown that by activating alpha-2 pathways, brimonidine can also enhance neuronal cell survival rates.

      "answers": [" Tetracycline   "],
      "explanation": "Tetracycline has a half-life of 8 hours and is classified as short-acting. It is most effective while taken on an empty stomach due to the fact that calcium, iron, and magnesium can decrease effectiveness or inactivate this medication. Remember, tetracycline should NEVER be prescribed to children because it will deposit in developing teeth and bones. Doxycycline has a half-life of 18 hours and is therefore categorized as a long-acting tetracycline. Doxycycline can be taken with or without food. Although it is more costly, doxycycline is generally favored over tetracycline because it brings about less gastrointestinal upset, therapeutic benefits can be achieved with smaller doses, less phototoxicity is experienced by the patient, and there is a decreased risk of kidney and liver toxicity. The effectiveness of Augmentin® and Keflex® remain unaltered if food is ingested."

      "answers": [" Drained through the nasolacrimal sac   ", " Spillover onto the cheek and face   "],
      "explanation": "When an ophthalmic medication is first instilled into the conjunctival sac, particularly suspensions and solutions, much of the drug is lost to spillover and drainage through the nasolacrimal duct, both of which are exacerbated by an increase in blinking. Research also reveals that some of the medication is lost to absorption into the conjunctival, anterior uveal, and episcleral vessels. A small portion of the medication is eliminated via trabecular and uveoscleral outflow once it becomes absorbed into the anterior chamber. Lastly, a minor amount is lost to absorption through limbal vessels and the tear film. &#10;&#10;Becker-Shaffer's Diagnosis and Therapy of the Glaucomas 9th edition.

Slit lamp exam reveals trichiasis, lid erythema, collarettes, and interpalpebral injection. You correctly diagnose him with chronic blepharitis. In addition to warm soaks and eyelid scrubs, what medication would BEST help him initially manage his blepharitis?",
      "options": [" Erythromycin ointment   ", " Petrolatum ointment  ", " Artificial tears  ", " Pred Forte® 1% ophthalmic drops  "],
      "answers": [" Erythromycin ointment   "],
      "explanation": "Erythromycin is a good antibacterial ointment for Gram-positive organisms. It works well for chronic, mild inflammatory cases of blepharitis and has very low potential for toxic and allergic reactions. Other good options would be Polysporin®, Bacitracin, gentamicin, or tobramycin ophthalmic ointments. Petrolatum ointment is good for excessive dryness but would combat neither the bacteria nor the inflammation. Pred Forte® would work well for the inflammatory component but would not help to resolve the infective portion. A good alternative for moderate to severe cases of blepharitis where lid scrubs might be too painful would be topical antibiotic-steroid combinations such as TobraDex®. Artificial tears are always good to keep the eye flushed and clean, but they must be used in conjunction with other regimens."

Loteprednol possesses an ester group in the carbon 20 position rather than a ketone group. Posterior capsular cataract formation occurs as a result of the interaction between the ketone group and lens proteins, causing the formation of a Schiff base intermediate and eventually leading to PSC development. Because loteprednol does not contain a ketone group, the probability of PSC formation is significantly diminished. &#10;&#10;http://www.reviewofcontactlenses.com/content/c/40953/"

      "explanation": "Prolonged use of topical anesthetics applied to the cornea causes softening and loosening of the epithelium. Although this property helps to increase absorption of other drugs such as those used for dilation, overuse can cause severe damage. The junctions between the epithelial cells can become disrupted to the point of corneal sloughing, leading to blurred vision or in severe cases, corneal opacification. Studies have shown that corneal softening occurs to a greater extent with tetracaine than with proparacaine. To date there have not been any correlations between proparacaine use and cataracts, miosis, arcus, or Fuch's dystrophy."

      "explanation": "Aminoglycosides are effective antimicrobial agents because they attach to the 30s subunit of the ribosomes of the bacteria, thus preventing the synthesis of proteins necessary for survival. Penicillin inhibits cell wall synthesis by binding to an enzyme needed to connect peptidoglycan chains together to form sheets that will eventually become cell walls. Cephalosporin's mechanism of action is similar to that of penicillin. Vancomycin binds to pentapeptides, thereby blocking elongation of the peptidoglycan necessary for cell wall synthesis."

      "explanation": "An excess of systemic copper is associated with Kayser-Fleischer rings and sunflower cataracts. The aforementioned signs are observed in Wilson's disease. This disease causes the body to retain too much copper. The excess copper is deposited in the liver, kidneys, brain, and eyes. Wilson's disease is typically diagnosed before the age of 40, and children generally display symptoms by 4 years of age. As optometrists, it is very important to be on guard for this disease. Initially, this copper deposition may present as a small brown/yellow crescent superiorly, followed by one inferiorly; both will eventually join together circumferentially. Symptoms and signs of Wilson's disease include but are not limited to confusion, dementia, difficulty moving arms and legs, ataxia (difficulty walking), jaundice of eyes and skin, and overall weakness. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent tissue damage."

      "question": "A 24-year old female patient presents at your office complaining of side effects that began when she started using Patanol® to treat her ocular allergies. She reports complete compliance with her eye drop administration. Which of the following symptoms is MOST likely associated with olopatadine (Patanol®) use?",
      "options": [" Headache   ", " Visual Hallucinations  ", " Gastrointestinal discomfort  ", " Tachycardia  ", " Depression  "],
      "answers": [" Headache   "],
      "explanation": "Topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers such as Patanol® (olopatadine) are commonly prescribed to relieve the symptoms associated with ocular allergies. They are a very effective class of medication due to their dual action mechanisms. Topical antihistamines that possess this dual action are olopatadine (Patanol®), ketotifen fumarate (Zaditor®), azelastine (Optivar®), and epinastine (Elestat®). The aforementioned drops serve to alleviate itching and redness by blocking H1 receptors as well as inhibiting mast cell and basophil degranulation. Side effects of topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizers include stinging upon instillation, headaches, and adverse taste (don't forget to inform your patients about punctual occlusion!). Tachycardia, depression, gastrointestinal discomfort, and visual hallucinations have not been reported with Patanol® use."

      "answers": [" Hematoma at the injection site   "],
      "explanation": "A common complication of sodium fluorescein injection is a hematoma at the injection site and/or extravasation of the fluorescein. Extravasation occurs when the fluorescein is mistakenly injected into the perivascular space instead of the vessel. If this occurs, patients will complain of a burning sensation at the injection site. Due to the pH of sodium fluorescein, extravasation may lead to necrosis of the tissue surrounding the injection site. Common side effects of sodium fluorescein injection include nausea, emesis, urticaria, and anaphylaxis (very rare). &#10;&#10;http://cms.revoptom.com/index.asp?ArticleType=SiteSpec&Page=osc/nov02/lesson_1102.htm &#10;&#10;Package insert of Fluorescein distributed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Anaphylaxis"

      "options": [" High polarity  ", " Water solubility  ", " Low pH  ", " Lipid solubility   "],
      "answers": [" Lipid solubility   "],
      "explanation": "Endothelial cells that line the walls of the brain's capillaries are joined via tight junctions. These connections form the blood-brain barrier. The tight junctions prevent large molecules and substances from passing through the spaces between cells. Instead, substances must cross through the actual cells themselves. Movement of desirable substances (such as glucose) across the barrier is achieved by carrier proteins found in the walls of the plasma membranes. However, some lipid-soluble agents can diffuse though the lipid bilayer. It is due to this flaw that nicotine, barbiturates, caffeine, heroine, alcohol, and other lipid-soluble drugs can readily pass through the membrane and cause rapid alteration of normal brain function."

      "options": [" Highly polar component  ", " Lipid solubility   ", " High alcohol content  ", " High pH  "],
      "answers": [" Lipid solubility   "],
      "explanation": "Ophthalmic drops that are comprised of both lipid (non-polar) and water-soluble (polar) components result in the most effective preparation. The tight junctions of the corneal epithelium keep hydrophilic drugs out but allow good penetration for lipid-soluble drugs. In contrast, the corneal stroma demonstrates good penetration for water-soluble agents. However, a HIGHLY polar agent will not cross the corneal epithelium; therefore, a mildly polar substance is advantageous over a highly polar agent. One should NEVER place alcohol on the eye as it will instantly debride the corneal epithelium; ALWAYS rinse all instruments used for ocular procedures with saline solution after sterilization with any agent that could be toxic to the cornea. Solutions with high pH (basic) are more damaging to the cornea than solutions with a lower pH (acidic). It is important to use solutions that are close to a neutral pH (7.0) to eliminate possible damage to the cornea."

      "answers": [" Chloroquine   ", " Amiodarone   "],
      "explanation": "Patients with vortex keratopathy (also known as whorl keratopathy or corneal verticillata) present with whorl-like corneal epithelial deposits that occur as a result of the ingestion of certain systemic medications. These characteristic corneal changes begin as fine greyish or brownish opacities in the inferior corneal epithelium that arborize and create a whorl-like pattern that swirls outward from a point just below the pupil, sparing the limbus. Although deposits typically involve the visual axis, patients do not experience a decrease in visual acuity; however, some may report the presence of haloes around lights. &#10;&#10;Common medications that cause vortex keratopathy include chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and amiodarone. In the case of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, there is no relationship between the development of keratopathy and the dosage or duration of treatment. Additionally, virtually all patients on amiodarone will develop corneal changes; however, the severity is associated with longer duration and higher dosage of the medication. Keratopathy is usually reversible on cessation of therapy. Other medications that may cause this corneal finding include indomethacin, tamoxifen and phenothiazines."

      "explanation": "Recurrent corneal erosions can occur in the event of trauma (especially involving organic matter) to the anterior cornea, specifically the epithelial basement membrane. In the case of recurrent corneal erosion, once the injury heals the epithelial cells do not adhere properly to the basement membrane causing them to slough off in a recurrent fashion. It can take several weeks or months for the cornea to re-establish the proper connections between epithelial cell layers. Recovery can be accelerated with hyperosmotic drops which serve to draw out excess water, helping to further strengthen and establish adhesion between the basement membrane and the overlying epithelium. Pilocarpine, emedastine difumarate and loteprednol will not help to prevent further erosions."

      "explanation": "Combined oral contraceptives are comprised of a synthetic estrogen and a synthetic progestin. The combination of the estrogen and progestin serves to inhibit the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which decreases follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), preventing follicular development and ovulation. COCPs can affect coagulation and lead to pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and stroke. COCP use can help to decrease the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer. Hypertension is also commonly linked with COCP. Smoking greatly increases many of the risks associated with COCPs."

      "answers": [" Increase aqueous outflow through the uveoscleral route   "],
      "explanation": "There are several mechanisms of action that intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering medications utilize to decrease the pressure in the eye. These include medications that work to decrease the production of aqueous and those that lower pressures by increasing the rate of outflow of aqueous humor. The medications that increase aqueous outflow also have two ways in which they may act: by increasing aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork, or by increasing aqueous outflow through the uveoscleral pathway. Prostaglandin analogs specifically affect the uveoscleral route by triggering a cascade of events that leads to degradation of collagen and subsequent opening of intracellular spaces. This allows for greater drainage of aqueous fluid out of the anterior chamber, resulting in lower intraocular pressure. &#10;&#10;Cholinergic agonists (such as pilocarpine) have a mechanism of action that works to also increase the outflow of aqueous; however, they specifically act on the trabecular meshwork pathway. &#10;&#10;Topical medications that decrease aqueous production include beta-blockers and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. &#10;&#10;It is important to note that alpha-2 agonists have a dual mechanism of action. This class of medication decreases IOP by both increasing uveoscleral outflow and decreasing aqueous production. &#10;&#10;Glaucoma: Medical Diagnosis & Therapy (Volume 1).

      "explanation": "Drugs that stimulate adrenergic receptors, also known as sympathomimetic drugs, actually cause mydriasis of the pupil as it stimulates the radial muscle of the iris, causing dilation. The parasympathetic system regulates constriction of the pupil through contraction of the circular muscle of the iris. One can achieve dilation of the pupil either through stimulation of the sympathetic system (i.e., eye drops that contain phenylephrine) or via blockage of the parasympathetic pathway (i.e., eye drops that contain tropicamide, which is parasympatholytic)."

      "options": [" Increased concentration of preservatives  ", " Decreased viscosity  ", " Prescribing the medication in suspension form  ", " Possessing a pH that is close to the physiological pH of the eye   "],
      "answers": [" Possessing a pH that is close to the physiological pH of the eye   "],
      "explanation": "An ophthalmic medication that possesses a pH that is as close to the natural pH of the tear film will generally cause less stinging and ocular irritation with instillation. A drop that results in stinging produces reflex tearing, which dilutes the topical medication, thereby decreasing its efficacy. A drug that results in ocular discomfort, for some patients, may also result in poor compliance with the dosing schedule. &#10;&#10;Generally, medications that are in suspension form are not as beneficial as those in emulsion form due to poor patient compliance with shaking of the bottle prior to use to properly distribute the medication; this lack of compliance causes inadvertent non-uniform dosing. Increased viscosity of the medication, although possibly leading to varying degrees of vision blurring, offers better ocular retention and better performance. Although there is some debate regarding toxic effects on the cornea by preservatives, the majority of clinicians agree that if a drop is used with increased frequency, a preservative-free formulation is beneficial to the patient."

      "answers": [" Decreasing low-density lipoproteins (LDL)   "],
      "explanation": "Elevated levels of low-density lipoproteins and triglycerides are associated with increased risk of heart disease and stroke because they can lead to plaque formation and build-up on the inside of arteries, which narrows the lumen of the blood vessels. HDLs aid in decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease; therefore, elevated levels of this type of cholesterol are desirable. HMG-CoA reductase is the enzyme found in the mevalonate pathway, which is responsible for the synthesis of cholesterol. Drugs that inhibit HMG-CoA reductase decrease the concentration of cholesterol in hepatic cells, which results in an increase in the synthesis of hepatic receptors for LDL. This in turn causes decreased levels of plasma LDL, thereby resulting in an increase in plasma HDL levels."

      "answers": [" Cyclosporine   ", " Methotrexate   ", " Dexamethasone   "],
      "explanation": "Interleukin-2 is an immunostimulant that promotes proliferation of T-helper cells and B lymphocytes making it very useful in combating cancer. Echinachea is an herb that has been purported to stimulate the immune system. &#10;&#10;Glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone, prednisone, and triamcinolone serve to decrease interleukin-1 production from macrophages and therefore decrease phagocytosis, thus suppressing immune response. Glucocorticoids can be used to treat autoimmune disorders and graft rejection. Methotrexate is also useful in treating autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis because its use results in a decrease in available methyl groups for synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, which are used in DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. Cyclosporine decreases the production of interleukin-2, making it useful in treating autoimmune disorders and preventing graft rejection."

      "answers": [" Pilocarpine   "],
      "explanation": "Accommodation can be stimulated by the installation of topical pilocarpine drops into the eye. Pilocarpine is a muscarinic agonist that, when applied, binds to muscarinic receptors, leading to contraction of the ciliary muscle. Accommodation by this process is known as involuntary accommodation, which is typically greater in amplitude than voluntary accommodation. In addition to being pharmacologically stimulated, accommodation can also be pharmacologically blocked (known as cycloplegia). Muscarinic antagonists such as tropicamide cause paralysis of the ciliary muscle by competitively binding and blocking muscarinic receptors, preventing acetylcholine (or other muscarinic agonists) from stimulating accommodation."

      "explanation": "Cromolyn sodium stabilizes mast cells but does not possess the ability to block H-1 receptor sites. Mast cell stabilizers are useful for chronic allergic eye disease but have an associated lag time and therefore do not provide instant relief of symptoms. Stabilization of mast cells results in prevention of inflammatory mediators such as histamine. Patanol® and Zaditor® are classified as dual-acting agents because they block H-1 receptor sites in addition to stabilizing mast cells preventing degranulation. Livostin® is a topical antihistamine that serves solely to block H-1 receptor sites and therefore is effective in suppressing itching, but does not result in long-term relief."

Talc can also deposit in the small blood vessels of the lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, and lymph nodes. Pulmonary complications may arise from talc deposits such as edema and fibrosis. It is important to ensure pulmonary health; therefore, x-rays of the lungs should be ordered.

      "answers": [" Lotemax® (0.5% loteprednol)   "],
      "explanation": "Lotemax® would be the best choice to provide immediate relief. Alrex® is a mild steroid that is frequently prescribed for seasonal allergic conjunctivitis; it is generally prescribed in conjunction with either a mast cell stabilizer or a dual-acting antihistamine such as Patanol®. However, in this case, because the patient is extremely symptomatic and a high degree of chemosis is present, it is best to go with a slightly stronger steroid such as Lotemax® rather than Alrex®. Steroids are used transiently and serve to give immediate relief from pruritus and edema, while the mast cell stabilizer helps to prevent further exacerbation for a longer time frame. Cromolyn sodium and Alomide® are mast cell stabilizers and are useful for chronic allergic reactions rather than acute ones. Upon initiation of treatment, mast cell stabilizers frequently have a lag time before resolution of symptoms and are therefore sometimes started prior to allergy season to ensure maximum therapeutic effect. 1% tropicamide will cause dilation of the eye but will not resolve any of her symptoms."

      "options": [" Loteprednol  ", " Rimexolone  ", " Dexamethasone   ", " Fluorometholone  "],
      "answers": [" Dexamethasone   "],
      "explanation": "Prolonged use of steroids both systemically and topically have been linked to an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP). The mechanism by which this occurs is most likely due to a decrease in the facility of aqueous outflow. Of the steroids mentioned, dexamethasone has the greatest tendency to result in increased IOP. Loteprednol is a steroid that minimally affects IOP and therefore should be used in cases where one is concerned about a potentially damaging rise in IOP."

      "question": "A 26-year old male presents in your office with an intraocular pressure of 28 mmHg in the right eye and 20 mmHg in the left eye. His cup-to-disc measurement is 0.5 vertically by 0.3 horizontally, with a superior notch in the right eye and 0.3 round in the left eye. You correctly diagnose him with primary open angle glaucoma. His ocular history is significant for a previous retinal detachment in the right eye six years prior that was repaired via laser photocoagulation. Which of the following glaucoma medications is strongly contraindicated unless there is a definite decision that the risk-benefit ratio makes using this medication acceptable?",
      "options": [" Lumigan® (bimatoprost)  ", " Xalatan® (latanoprost)  ", " Alphagan-P® (brimonidine tartrate)  ", " Timoptic® (timolol maleate)  ", " Pilocarpine   "],
      "answers": [" Pilocarpine   "],
      "explanation": "Pilocarpine should not be prescribed to this patient for several reasons. First, he is young and pilocarpine should not be prescribed to patients less than 40 years old as it can increase the risk of early cataract formation. Secondly, he has a history of a retinal detachment; pilocarpine use increases the likelihood of retinal detachment. All of the other choices would be suitable; however, it is best to start with a prostaglandin as this class of anti-glaucoma medication generally results in good compliance since it needs to be administered once daily; it also leads to excellent intraocular pressure stability. &#10;&#10;Other reasons not to prescribe pilocarpine as a primary glaucoma treatment include the fact that it can create a brow ache, cause an increase in myopia and it constricts the pupil thereby reducing acuity under low light levels."

      "answers": [" Zyrtec® (cetirizine)   "],
      "explanation": "Oral H-1 antihistamines have several ocular indications. Common H-1 oral antihistamines include Claritin® (loratidine), Zyrtec® (cetirizine), Allegra® (fexofenadine), Clarinex® (desloratadine), and Benadryl® (diphenhydramine). The oral antihistamines serve to alleviate symptoms associated with a Type I allergic response which can include itching, lid edema, chemosis, and excessive tearing. Oral antihistamines can also be recommended for lid myokymia which, although irritating, is not sight-threatening. It is important to distinguish between first generation and second generation oral antihistamines because first generation oral antihistamines (Benadryl®) cause central nervous system (CNS) depression and drowsiness. The second generation oral antihistamines (Claritin®, Zyrtec®, Allegra®, and Clarinex®) are non-sedating as they do not penetrate the CNS. Voltaren® is an NSAID and will not alter the duration of lid myokymia; neither will prednisolone or bimatoprost (Lumigan®)."

Most studies purport that roughly 10% (although recent studies suggest 1% or less) of patients who are allergic to penicillin may also potentially exhibit an allergic response to the first-generation cephalosporins. The cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins is almost non-existent with the third-generation cephalosporins. Although the chances of a patient possessing a cross-reactivity between penicillin and cephalosporin drugs is very rare, it is best to prescribe an alternate antibiotic when a known allergy to penicillins exists. &#10;&#10;Reference: &#10;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1070890/"

      ],
      "answers": [" If prescribed for longer than one week, steroids should be tapered   "],
      "explanation": "If a patient is prescribed topical steroid therapy for longer than one week then the medication should be tapered to avoid a possible relapse. Medrysone is a synthetic derivative of progesterone and has extremely limited corneal penetration. Steroids are strictly anti-inflammatory agents and do not possess any anti-infective capabilities. If a bacterial infection is suspected along with inflammation, it is best to use a combination anti-microbial/steroid drop such as TobraDex® (tobramycin and dexamethasone) or Zylet® (tobramycin and loteprednol). The anti-inflammatory effects resulting from steroid use are NON-SPECIFIC. All tissues that come in contact with the medication will be equally affected as long as the penetration rate is equal, regardless of whether the etiology is trauma, allergy, or from an infectious process."

      "answers": [" Glycerine   "],
      "explanation": "Oral hyperosmotic agents may be utilized if there is a failure of initial medical treatment in controlling intraocular pressure in patients with acutely elevated intraocular pressure (as in angle closure). They are rarely administered for longer than a few hours, as their effects are only transient. &#10;Glycerine is an oral hyperosmotic agent that is metabolized into glucose; therefore, it should not be used in diabetics (unless they are very well controlled). &#10;Isosorbide is a metabolically inert oral hyperosmotic agent, which allows it to be used in patients with diabetes without consequence. &#10;Mannitol is also a hyperosmotic agent but is only available by intravenous delivery. &#10;Acetazolamide and methazolamine are oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors."

Colchicine is commonly used to treat gout and Behcet's disease. Methotrexate has many uses; among the most common are treatment of severe psoriasis, severe active rheumatoid arthritis, and life-threatening cancer. Methotrexate has many adverse effects and therefore is reserved for severe conditions where other treatments have failed. Methotrexate use can cause bone marrow depression, hepatic cirrhosis, teratogenesis, and possible death. Mercaptopurine is part of a class of drugs referred to as purine antagonists and is commonly used to treat acute lymphocytic leukemia, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis."

      "options": [
        " Minimize the risk of developing steroid-induced elevation of IOP  ",
        " Prevent possible secondary ocular infections  ",
        " Minimize risk of adrenal insufficiency due to decreased production of natural cortisol  ",
        " Decrease the risk of posterior subcapsular cataract formation  ",
        " Avoid signs and symptoms of rebound ocular inflammation   "
      ],
      "answers": [" Avoid signs and symptoms of rebound ocular inflammation   "],
      "explanation": "When prescribing a topical ocular corticosteroid, the tapering schedule of the medication is just as important as the initial dose. It is imperative not to prematurely discontinue steroid medications and to closely monitor the patient for signs of rebound inflammation during and after the tapering process. The mechanism for developing rebound inflammation stems from the fact that prolonged use of corticosteroids causes a reduction in the amount of mature circulating leukocytic elements. If the steroid is stopped abruptly, the immature cells can proliferate, producing large quantities of antibodies in response to the residual antigen remaining in the tissue. This physiologic action is what causes rebound inflammation. The exaggerated inflammatory response is more commonly associated with systemic steroid use, but prolonged topical ocular therapy (usually longer than 1 month) can also induce this response. &#10;&#10;A typical steroid taper should begin once the inflammation is completely controlled. There are many different tapering schedules that may be implemented depending on the patient's condition, but classically, the dose of the steroid should be halved for each given time interval. For example, if you prescribed a steroid q.i.d. x 5 days, you could taper to b.i.d. x 5 days, then q.day x 5 days. The longer the treatment period or more frequent the dosage, the longer the taper will be. &#10;&#10;With long-term oral corticosteroid use, there is a risk of developing adrenal insufficiency if the steroid is not tapered properly. This is due to the fact that the adrenal glands decrease their normal production of natural cortisol when an individual is taking a dose of steroids. Tapering the steroid is important such that the adrenal glands can return to producing habitual levels of cortisol before complete cessation of the oral steroids."

      "answers": [" Myopic shift   ", " Angle closure   "],
      "explanation": "Topamax® is an anticonvulsant medication that is frequently prescribed for people suffering from epilepsy. This medication is also used to help manage bipolar disorder, migraines, and depression. Topamax® has been shown to cause uveal effusion and swelling of the ciliary body, potentially causing pupillary block and angle closure. A myopic shift is also commonly observed. Generally, the above side effects will occur 2 weeks after the institution of Topamax® therapy. It is important to note that in the event of angle closure due to Topamax®, a peripheral laser iridotomy will not be effective; this emergency must be managed via discontinuation of the medication and the use of topical steroids and a cycloplegic agent."

It is frequently utilized in the treatment of keratitis caused by acanthamoeba, as is polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB). Fungizone® and Natacyn® are classified as polyenes and serve to treat infections associated with fungi via binding to the ergosterol of fungal cell membranes. Both are frequently utilized to treat fusarium-associated keratitis. Natacyn® is also commonly used to treat candida and aspergillus infections. Nizoral® is found in anti-dandruff shampoos as well as in antifungal drugs to prevent fungal and skin infections, especially for immunocompromised patients such as those with AIDS or undergoing chemotherapy. Diflucan® is used to treat fungal infections like those caused by yeast infections; it is also utilized to treat meningitis caused by fungi."

      "answers": [" Non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells  "],
      "explanation": "Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors decrease active aqueous humor secretion by blocking carbonic anhydrase in the non-pigmented ciliary epithelial cells present in the ciliary processes. Carbonic anhydrase plays a central role in aqueous secretion by generating bicarbonate ions. Carbonic anhydrase is an isoenzyme found solely in the non-pigmented ciliary body epithelium; it catalyzes carbon dioxide hydration and conversion to carbonic acid, which freely dissociates into bicarbonate anions and protons. Bicarbonate formation then influences fluid transport by affecting sodium. Blockage of carbonic anhydrase by the use of topical or oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors reduces the formation of bicarbonate ions, thus reducing fluid transport and subsequently decreasing intraocular pressure."

      "question": "Which of the following glaucoma medications is classified as a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor?",
      "options": [" Physostigmine (Eserine®)  ", " Pilocarpine  ", " Echothiophate Iodide (Phospholine Iodide®)  ", " Acetazolamide (Diamox®)   "],
      "answers": [" Acetazolamide (Diamox®)   "],
      "explanation": "Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors serve to decrease intraocular pressure by suppression of carbonic anhydrase (as the name of their drug class indicates), which causes a decrease in aqueous production. Remember, oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) can cause a metallic taste, paraesthesia, electrolyte imbalance, and aplastic anemia, among other side effects. Because CAIs contain sulfonamide, it is of utmost importance to ensure that the patient is not allergic to sulfa-based drugs. Also, CAI medications can deplete potassium levels, so be sure that patients are eating bananas or drinking orange juice to compensate for this loss.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Oral Glaucoma Medications"

      "explanation": "Ophthalmic drugs that are classified as beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and sympathomimetics act in a manner that decreases aqueous production, subsequently having a lowering effect on the intraocular pressure. Trusopt ® is a glaucoma medication that belongs to a class of drugs called carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and is the only medication listed above that decreases aqueous production. Xalatan® and Travatan® are prostaglandin analogs. Pilocarpine is a cholinergic parasympathomimetic agent and increases the outflow of aqueous humor.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Topical Glaucoma Medications- Part 2"

      "question": "A dilated fundus exam reveals white crystalline deposits within the macular region of your patient. Which of the following medications is MOST likely responsible for causing these deposits?",
      "options": [" Plaquenil®  ", " Amiodarone  ", " Ciprofloxacin  ", " Tamoxifen   "],
      "answers": [" Tamoxifen   "],
      "explanation": "Tamoxifen; is frequently used in the treatment of breast cancer. Patients taking this medication may experience decreased visual acuity due to white crystalline retinal deposits; these are most densely concentrated around the paramacular region. Tamoxifen; may also cause corneal deposits, cystoid macular edema, grey lesions within the RPE, retinal hemorrhages, and optic disc edema. &#10;&#10;Plaquenil® is an anti-malarial drug that is frequently prescribed to treat systemic lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The medication binds to melanin and accumulates in the retina, leading to macular mottling and retinal pigment epithelial disruptions and often resulting in what is known as 'bull's eye maculopathy'. &#10;&#10;Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic medication. Use of this drug commonly causes yellow/brown or white powdery corneal epithelial deposits located infero-centrally that appear to swirl outward while sparing the limbus (vortex keratopathy). &#10;&#10;Fluoroquinolones are a powerful class of antibiotics that inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase but, when taken orally, pose a risk of tendon rupture and tendinitis. The risk of the aforementioned side effects increases in individuals over the age of 60 or those with renal failure or taking oral steroids or in people who have undergone an organ transplant. Fluoroquinolone use also may be associated with diplopia."

      "answers": [" Mydriasis   "],
      "explanation": "Scopolamine use commonly results in cycloplegia and mydriasis because it is a parasympatholytic drug; it blocks parasympathetic input, causing pupil dilation. A common clinical presentation of a 'pseudo-blown pupil' occurs when a person applies the patch to their skin and then accidentally touches one eye. The inadvertently touched eye then becomes dilated and vision blurs secondary to the cycloplegic properties of scopolamine. To date there have been no correlations between scopolamine use and cataracts, poliosis, or nystagmus."

However, many patients were sensitive to this component and suffered allergic or toxic reactions to the solution. It is now rarely, if at all, utilized by manufacturers of contact lens solutions. BAK, polyquad, and hydrogen peroxide are all good disinfectants currently used in contact lens cleaning solutions. People who suffer from allergies or have sensitive eyes are encouraged to use a hydrogen peroxide-based cleaning solution as it does not contain any preservatives."

      "question": "Which of the following drugs is MOST EFFECTIVE against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)?",
      "options": [" Polytrim®   ", " Erythromycin  ", " Ciloxan®  ", " Pred-Forte®  "],
      "answers": [" Polytrim®   "],
      "explanation": "Polytrim® is most effective against MRSA. MRSA is a bacterial strain that can cause severe infections and is highly resistant to many antibiotics. MRSA is most commonly seen in people that have been in a health care setting such as a hospital or nursing home, and when contracted by this method, it is termed Health care-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA). HA-MRSA is typically associated with invasive procedures such as surgeries. MRSA is also seen in healthy communities (termed community-associated MRSA or CA-MRSA) such as child care workers or high school wrestlers and is transmitted by direct skin-to-skin contact. Unfortunately, MRSA is becoming more prominent; therefore, it is of utmost importance that when a patient presents with conjunctivitis, we as clinicians should always have MRSA in the back of our minds. MRSA is best treated with fortified vancomycin; however, as optometrists, we rarely if ever have this at our disposal. Many studies have shown that bacitracin and Polytrim® display excellent penetration to ocular infections caused by MRSA. Bacitracin and Polytrim® are often overlooked as antimicrobials because they are slightly archaic; however, given that MRSA-related ocular infections are increasing, this is an important finding. Both erythromycin and ciprofloxacin (Ciloxan®) show very poor sensitivities for MRSA. Pred-Forte®, especially by itself, should not be prescribed due to the fact that it suppresses the immune system and treats only inflammation, further enabling the infection. The fourth and fifth generation fluoroquinolones such as Zymar® and Besivance® demonstrate good efficacy against MRSA and are good alternatives; however, Polytrim® remains more effective and therefore should be the first choice when treating ocular infections associated with MRSA."

      "answers": [" Sodium   "],
      "explanation": "Proparacaine and other ocular anesthetics are thought to cause local numbness by binding to and antagonizing the function of voltage-gated sodium channels located within a neuronal cell membrane. This action results in an alteration of the permeability of the cell membrane, therefore limiting the sodium ion penetration through the lipid layer of the nerve cell membrane. This limitation subsequently prevents the fundamental change necessary for the cell to generate an action potential. &#10;&#10;http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00807"

      "answers": [" Affinity   "],
      "explanation": "The affinity of a drug for a receptor is a measure of how tightly and how able the drug in question binds to the receptor. Affinity is typically determined by the chemical structure of the drug. &#10;&#10;The efficacy of a drug is a measure of the drug's ability to produce a biological effect or initiate a biological change once it is bound to the receptor. Efficacy is used to characterize the level of maximal response by a drug. &#10;&#10;It is important to note that drug affinity and efficacy do not go hand-in-hand. A drug may have a high affinity to a receptor but have minimal efficacy and vice versa. &#10;&#10;The potency of a drug refers to the amount of a drug that is required to achieve a desired biological effect. A drug that requires a lower dose is considered more potent than a drug that requires a higher dosage to have the same effect. &#10;&#10;An Introduction to Medicinal Chemistry (5th edition).

      "question": "Which of the following medications should be prescribed to a patient suffering from shingles to help decrease the chances of postherpetic neuralgia?",
      "options": [" Prednisolone  ", " Viroptic® (trifluridine)  ", " Zovirax® (acyclovir)   ", " Natacyn® (natamycin)  "],
      "answers": [" Zovirax® (acyclovir)   "],
      "explanation": "Postherpetic neuralgia is a painful condition that can last for months to years after the resolution of lesions that occur with shingles. Shingles is caused by the virus Varicella zoster, which causes chicken pox. Shingles are generally experienced by patients who have already had chicken pox and are elderly or immunocompromised. After resolution of chicken pox, the virus lays dormant in the root of the nerves and, for reasons that remain unclear at this time, becomes reactivated later on in life, causing shingles. Shingles presents as lesions on only one side of the body or is limited to a specific dermatome. Initially, one may only first experience a headache followed by tingling, itching, or sensitivity in the affected area. A rash will then develop in this area, followed by lesions that eventually blister over. Lesions do not always appear. Shingles cannot be contracted from one person to another; however, if a person has never been infected with chicken pox, it is possible to contract chicken pox from a person suffering from shingles. Oral antiviral agents like acyclovir, famciclovir or valacyclovir should be initiated within 72 hours of the onset of skin lesions to help minimize the chances of postherpetic neuralgia. Viroptic® is a topical antiviral frequently utilized for Herpes simplex. Natacyn® is an antifungal. Prednisolone, although useful for treating pain associated with shingles, does not help in preventing postherpetic neuralgia."

      "question": "A patient taking ethambutol for treatment of her tuberculosis is seen at your office. Which of the following is the MOST important test to perform to evaluate for possible neurotoxicity?",
      "options": [" Pupil testing  ", " A subjective refraction  ", " Visual field testing  ", " Color vision testing   "],
      "answers": [" Color vision testing   "],
      "explanation": "Ethambutol (EMB) is a medication that is commonly used as a treatment for tuberculosis as well as Mycobacterium avium lung disease. Ocular complications include optic and retrobulbar neuritis. Patients may report decreased visual acuity, a color vision deficit, central scotomas, or constriction of visual fields. Bitemporal visual field defects may also occur. Ophthalmoscopic findings are typically unremarkable. It is thought that the small papillo-macular bundle axons are affected in ethambutol toxicity. Because these axons are small, optic atrophy will not be visualized until months after the damage has occurred. Once the medication is discontinued, visual signs and symptoms typically improve, although in rare cases, the deficits may remain permanently. Current protocol recommends that patients on 15mg/kg/day of ethambutol should receive monthly routine check-ups during which visual acuity and color vision are evaluated. However, in the event that all exam findings are unremarkable in a patient taking EMB but the patient reports visual symptoms, the medication should be discontinued. Signs and/or symptoms typically develop 2-5 months after the initiation of therapy. Further investigations are currently underway to determine the effectiveness of OCT on the early detection of ethambutol ocular-related toxicity. &#10;&#10;References: &#10;http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.200407-863OC#.UoA_feKwXXk &#10;http://www.eyedrugregistry.com/PDFs/AAO_Syllabus.pdf"

      "explanation": "Topamax® is a drug that is commonly used as an anti-seizure medication but may also be used in the management of migraines, depression, and bipolar disorder as well as to promote weight loss. Use of this drug can cause uveal effusions, leading to swelling of the ciliary body and narrowing of the angle (forward displacement of the lens-iris diaphragm) and leading to myopia and angle-closure glaucoma. Patients who report blurred vision with the use of Topamax® should immediately discontinue the medication due to the increased risk of developing angle-closure glaucoma.

      ],
      "answers": [" Oral doxycycline 50 mg twice daily for 1 month   "],
      "explanation": "Doxycycline is a good antibiotic to prescribe when blepharitis is unusually severe or persistent or if patients are unable to perform lid hygiene. Doxycycline is preferred over tetracycline because it may be taken with meals and boasts better compliance, as it only requires administration twice-a-day vs. every six hours. Benadryl® is a great oral antihistamine but is not a good option for blepharitis management. Re-prescribing a previous regimen is not a great alternative, as the patient has already displayed poor compliance, and most likely, she/he will not adhere to those instructions again. Prescribing oral prednisone is overkill and should only be reserved for severe inflammatory conditions."

      "explanation": "Warfarin is an anti-coagulant frequently prescribed to patients with a history of stroke, blood clots, or a heart attack. Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug. When amiodarone is taken concurrently with warfarin, it enhances warfarin's mechanism of action, which can result in dramatically increased clotting times and prolonged bleeding. In the event that the two medications are prescribed simultaneously, it is recommended that the dosage of warfarin be halved. Patients who experience unusual bruising or bleeding, blood in their stool, vomiting, nausea, or dizziness are encouraged to consult with their physician immediately. Other medications that have the potential to interact with warfarin include aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, heparin, certain antibiotics, birth control pills, and cold and allergy medications.

      "options": [" Sodium fluorescein  ", " Lissamine green  ", " Rose Bengal  ", " Methylene blue   "],
      "answers": [" Methylene blue   "],
      "explanation": "Methylene blue is used to stain devitalized cells, mucus, and corneal nerves. Methylene blue is also employed to stain the lacrimal sac prior to surgery for dacryocystorhinoplasty. It is important to note that methylene blue is bacteriostatic, therefore, one should do a cell culture (if necessary) prior to any application of methylene blue. Lissamine green stains dead or degenerated cells and therefore is useful for early detection of dry eye syndrome. Rose Bengal is similar to lissamine green in that it stains degenerated and dead cells as well as mucous stands. Rose Bengal can be used to evaluate dry eye, corneal and conjunctival lesions, and dendrites. Lissamine green and Rose Bengal both have mild anti-viral properties. Sodium fluorescein is actually not a stain but a dye. This dye is useful for detection of conjunctival and corneal lesions because it accumulates in the defect and fluoresces when used in conjunction with a cobalt blue filter. It is also useful in fitting gas-permeable lenses and for evaluating the tear break-up time. Fluorescein can be administered intravenously to help detect retinal neovascularization, macular lesions, central serous retinopathy, malignant melanomas, etc."

      "answers": [" Inhibition of T-cell activation   "],
      "explanation": "While the exact mechanism of action of cyclosporine remains controversial, it is generally accepted that cyclosporine inhibits calcineurin in CD4+ T helper cells which, under normal circumstances, are responsible for production of interleukin-2 (IL-2). IL-2 normally stimulates activation and proliferation of cytotoxic T cells and other helper T cells. Cyclosporine prevents this activation and acts as an anti-inflammatory. One of the major causes of KCS is autoimmune destruction of lacrimal cells by T cells. Therefore, topical cyclosporine can be protective. In all likelihood, there are likely additional mechanisms of action for cyclosporine in the treatment of KCS, but this is one of the most accepted mechanisms and is the best option from the choices given here."

      "answers": [" Rectal   "],
      "explanation": "First pass metabolism indicates that the drug is metabolized by the liver prior to being dispersed into the general circulation throughout the body. Drugs administered rectally and orally will travel to the liver first, resulting in variable first pass metabolism. This results in unpredictable drug delivery. Both buccal (the drug is placed against the cheek) and sublingual (drug placed under the tongue) avoid first pass metabolism and therefore ensure rapid delivery. Intrathecal injection refers to the administration of a drug via injection into the spinal canal (subarachnoid space), allowing delivery to the desired organ via cerebrospinal fluid without first being metabolized by the liver. &#10;&#10;References: &#10;&#10;Models for Assessing Drug Absorption and Metabolism.

      ],
      "answers": [" Prescribe the therapeutic dose in one sitting every other day   "],
      "explanation": "Alternate day therapy is a good option that allows for minimization or elimination of growth suppression. Alternate day therapy is achieved by prescribing the entire therapeutic dose to the patient every other morning. This prescribing pattern allows for metabolic recovery of the system. However, this type of therapy is ONLY effective for short-acting steroids like prednisone. Triamcinolone and dexamethasone are both long-acting steroids and therefore are not applicable for alternate day therapy. Substitution of different steroids and daily therapy would still result in delayed skeletal maturation because systemic steroid levels would remain high due to continual ingestion.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Steroids"

      "question": "Which of the following 3 agents may help increase tear production? (Select 3)",
      "options": [" Testosterone   ", " Isotretinoin (Accutane®)  ", " Pilocarpine   ", " Oral contraceptives  ", " Cyclosporine   ", " Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®)  "],
      "answers": [" Testosterone   ", " Pilocarpine   ", " Cyclosporine   "],
      "explanation": "Cyclosporine serves to increase tear production by decreasing contributory underlying inflammation. When taken orally, pilocarpine has been demonstrated to increase salivary and tear production. Testosterone stimulates tear production and therefore is also linked to helping decrease dry eye. As we age, hormone levels decrease, as does tear production. One problem with testosterone therapy is the risk that too much testosterone can result in voice changes and growth of body hair; it is therefore very important to monitor dosage levels. &#10;&#10;Oral contraceptives, antihistamines, and anti-acne medications can be associated with causing dry eyes."

      "question": "Prolonged use of which of the following medications may cause fine, pigmentary mottling of the macular area, resulting in what is known as a 'Bull's-eye lesion' along with impaired color vision?",
      "options": [" Tetracycline  ", " Tenormin® (atenolol)  ", " Zoloft® (sertraline)  ", " Aralen® (chloroquine)   "],
      "answers": [" Aralen® (chloroquine)   "],
      "explanation": "Aralen® is an anti-malarial drug that is frequently prescribed to treat systemic lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The medication binds to melanin and accumulates in the retina, leading to macular mottling and retinal pigment epithelial disruptions, eventually progressing to bone spicule formation, vascular attenuation, optic disc pallor, and atrophy. Symptoms can include visual field loss, decreased visual acuity, and impaired color vision. Hydroxychloroquine is utilized more frequently since it poses less risk for retinal toxicity. With chloroquine use, risk for retinopathy increases with dosages greater than 3.5 mg/kg/d or a cumulative dosage of 460 g. For hydroxychloroquine, retinopathy can occur with 6.5 mg/kg/d or a cumulative dose of 1000 g. When examining a patient who is being treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, be sure to pay close attention to the Amsler grid and color vision results, although recent literature has recommended macular OCT as the most sensitive test to assess retinal damage."

      "answers": [" Tetracyclines inhibit bacterial lipase production, thereby reducing the concentration of deleterious free fatty acids   "],
      "explanation": "Tetracyclines are commonly used in the treatment of chronic posterior blepharitis due to their ability to inhibit bacterial lipase production, which in turn reduces the concentration of free fatty acids that cause inflammation and irritation to the eyelids. Tetracyclines also result in decreased concentration of bacteria on the eyelids, but this drug is not bactericidal. &#10;&#10;Restasis® is a medicated eye drop that is occasionally used in the treatment of dry eye associated with posterior blepharitis. Its mechanism of action involves inhibiting the activation of T-cells, which normally lead to inflammation and decreased tear production. &#10;&#10;Omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil) are also very commonly used in management of posterior blepharitis due to their effects on modulating synthesis of both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory prostaglandins."

      "explanation": "Certain molecules, when stimulated by light of a shorter wavelength, will become excited to a higher energy level and emit light of a longer wavelength. This property is known as fluorescence and is utilized in ocular diagnostic tests such as fluorescein angiography. The molecule of fluorescein has an excitation peak at close to 490nm, which represents its maximal absorption of light energy (blue range of the spectrum). Molecules of fluorescein that are stimulated by this wavelength of light will emit light of a longer wavelength in the range of 530nm (green part of the spectrum). &#10;&#10;During fluorescein angiography, certain filters are used to ensure that only this range of blue light enters the eye and only yellow-green light reaches the camera to be recorded."

      "explanation": "Thimerosal and BAK are microbial agents and can be used in small doses as preservatives on extraocular surfaces; however, if used intraocularly they will result in iritis, cataract formation, and death of corneal endothelial cells. Saline is not an acceptable intraocular irrigating solution because it does not contain the electrolytes needed to maintain proper isotonicity of the corneal endothelium (such as calcium, magnesium, glucose, sodium, potassium, etc.); this will result in swelling and lysis of the endothelial cells. BSS is frequently used for short-term intraocular surgeries as it is isotonic to ocular tissue and contains electrolytes that are needed for normal cell functions."

      "explanation": "Doxycycline, tetracycline, and minocycline belong to the tetracycline class of medications. These antibiotics are frequently used in the treatment of acne, meibomian gland dysfunction, and other infections. Although the mechanism as to why intracranial hypertension occurs remains unclear at this time, all of these medications have the potential to cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension (also known as pseudotumor cerebri or PTC). Because minocycline possesses a high lipid solubility, it has a higher affinity to pass into the cerebrospinal fluid, which may lead to benign (idiopathic) intracranial hypertension. &#10;&#10;Unlike the typical form of PTC, increased intracranial hypertension as a result of 'cycline medication' use occurs equally in males and females and does not have a predilection for overweight females of child-bearing age. The time lag for the development of PTC after the initiation of 'cycline' therapy remains unclear, as some patients may displays signs after two weeks of taking the medication while others do not report symptoms until a year has passed after the commencement of therapy. Patients on a 'cycline' medication who report headaches, diplopia, or present with sixth cranial nerve palsy or swollen optic nerves should cease taking this medication. &#10;&#10;References: &#10;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1125522/ &#10;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/624295"

      "question": "Topical ophthalmic medications prescribed in an emulsion form prove to be advantageous over suspensions because of which of the following reasons?",
      "options": [
        " Uniform concentration of medication in each drop   ",
        " The addition of a light dye to allow for easy patient observation to ensure the drop was effectively instilled into the eye  ",
        " They need to be refrigerated, offering ocular comfort and better compliance with instillation  ",
        " Decreased retention time, resulting in less burring of vision  "
      ],
      "answers": [" Uniform concentration of medication in each drop   "],
      "explanation": "Ophthalmic medications in suspension form must be shaken well to allow for even concentration and distribution of the medication. If the medication is not re-suspended, uniform dosing of the medication will not be achieved; this can interfere with treatment efficacy, particularly when treating inflammation. Prescribing a medication that does not require shaking, such as an emulsion, ointment, or gel, allows for better therapeutic performance. Studies have demonstrated that the majority of patients do NOT shake the bottle adequately prior to drop instillation, even when explicitly instructed to vigorously agitate the bottle before use. &#10;&#10;Emulsions tend to be somewhat more viscous than suspensions and therefore purport better ocular retention time. However, patients may experience a slightly increased degree of transient blurring of vision with the use of emulsions. &#10;&#10;Refrigeration of medication is dependent upon the property of the medication itself. Emulsions do not necessarily need to be placed in the refrigerator. If the drug permits, some patients prefer to refrigerate their ophthalmic medication because it is easier to ascertain if the drop was successfully instilled into the eye and may also lead to improved ocular comfort upon administration. &#10;&#10;Dyes are not typically added to ophthalmic medications."

      "answers": [" Depressed skeletal growth   "],
      "explanation": "Tetracycline, when administered to children, can lead to short stature due to the fact that tetracycline becomes incorporated into calcifying bone, leading to stunting of growth. Tetracycline also causes yellowing of teeth because it can be integrated into dentin and enamel in developing teeth; this is yet another reason not to prescribe tetracycline to children. Other common side effects of tetracycline include allergic response, photosensitization, and GI distress. Tetracycline has not been known to cause urinary tract infections (it would actually serve to treat them), bone marrow depression, or thromboembolisms."

      "explanation": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a dangerous pathogen that is most commonly found in hospital settings and long-term care facilities. Studies have shown that approximately 35% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates in the U.S. are considered methicillin-resistant. MRSA is resistant to all of the beta-lactam antibiotics, which include penicillin derivatives and cephalosporins. Additionally, many MRSA strains are also resistant to all generations of fluoroquinolones, as well as multiple other classes of antibiotics. At the present time, vancomycin has emerged as the most reliable agent for the treatment of MRSA infections and is therefore the drug of choice under these circumstances. &#10;&#10;Hospital Medicine (2nd edition).

      "explanation": "Vitamin B2 is also known as riboflavin. Riboflavin is important for the metabolism of nutrients. Because it is yellow or yellow/orange in color, riboflavin is frequency used to color foods. A deficiency (although quite rare) of vitamin B2 can lead to several ocular complications such as photophobia, corneal neovascularization and keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Dry, cracked lips, ulcers of the mouth, and sore throat may also be experienced. Some studies have reported that vitamin B2 supplementation may decrease the risk of cataracts."

      "explanation": "Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, is a powerful antioxidant. Vitamin C facilitates the absorption of dietary iron. It is also a cofactor in many enzymatic reactions, including the synthesis of collagen. Avitaminosis C results in scurvy caused by the creation of unstable collagen. Scurvy presents with general weakness, anemia, brown spots on the skin, spongy gums, petechial hemorrhages of the skin and mucous membranes, proptosis and feelings of paralysis, amongst other symptoms. Advanced cases are remarkable for open suppurative wounds, loss of teeth, and death. Interesting fact: Broccoli contains more vitamin C than oranges, 90mg/100mg vs. 50mg/100mg. The kakadu plum contains a whopping 3100mg/100mg of vitamin C!! Severe alcoholics can become victims of scurvy due to malnutrition."

      "options": [" Vitamin A   ", " Vitamin C  ", " Zinc  ", " Vitamin E  ", " Copper  "],
      "answers": [" Vitamin A   "],
      "explanation": "Vitamin A should not be recommended for this patient. Although Vitamin A is recommended by the Age-Related Eye Disease Study I (AREDS I), it cannot be used in patients who currently smoke or have a recent history of smoking. Vitamin A (beta-carotene) is correlated with a higher risk of developing lung cancer. All of the above other vitamins and minerals should be recommended to help slow the progression of macular degeneration. AREDS I suggests the following formula for ocular vitamins: Vitamin A (beta carotene) 25,000 IU, Vitamin E 400 IU, Vitamin C 500 mg, Zinc 80 mg, Copper 2 mg. AREDS 2 is currently underway to evaluate the benefits of adding lutein and zeaxanthin along with omega III long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids to the formula. Vitamin A is also important for maintaining epithelial cells such as those found on the lens, controlling mucous production, and mediating dark adaptation."

      "answers": [" Tetracyclines   ", " Naladixic acid   ", " Oral contraceptives   "],
      "explanation": "Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (also known as pseudotumor cerebri) is defined as the presence of elevated intracranial pressure in the absence of an intracranial space-occupying lesion, or enlargement of the ventricles due to hydrocephalus. Eye care professionals are often the first to identify this condition due to the development of visual symptoms resulting from papilledema. Several risk factors for this condition have been identified, with the majority of patients falling into a category of overweight women of childbearing age. Other associations include the use of several medications, most notably tetracyclines, naladixic acid, and oral contraceptives. Steroids, vitamin A, isotretinoin (Accutane®), growth hormones, sulfa drugs, tamoxifen, thyroid replacement therapy, and phenytoin have also been shown to have a correlation with this condition."

      "answers": [" Vitamin B1   "],
      "explanation": "Vitamin B1 is also known as thiamine. Thiamine is important for carbohydrate metabolism and the maintenance of neuronal tissue. Although rarely seen in the United States due to the fact that most foods are enriched with vitamins, a B1 deficiency can result in beriberi. Symptoms of beriberi include difficulty walking, loss of sensation in hands and feet, paralysis (due to deterioration of myelin sheath), nystagmus, speech difficulty/mental confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and congestive heart failure. Alcoholism can lead to beriberi due to malnutrition. Vitamin B2, also known as riboflavin, aids in the metabolism of nutrients. Avitaminosis B2 can result in decreased visual acuity due to corneal neovascularization, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or cataract formation. Vitamin B3 (a.k.a. niacin) is responsible for fat and carbohydrate metabolism. A deficiency of Vitamin B3 can cause pellagra, which results in diarrhea, dementia, and dermatitis. Niacin can be used to treat hyperlipoproteinemia. Vitamin B6, also called pyridoxine, serves an important role as a coenzyme for the formation of hemoglobin as well as amino acid and protein metabolism."

      "options": [" Vitamin D  ", " Vitamin K  ", " Vitamin C  ", " Vitamin A   "],
      "answers": [" Vitamin A   "],
      "explanation": "A deficiency of vitamin A also known as beta carotene will lead to a decrease in the number of goblet cells. Because goblet cells are responsible for the secretion of mucin into the tears, a smaller number of them will result in a lower concentration of mucin production. A deficiency of vitamin A also causes prolonged dark adaptation. Vitamin A is classified as a retinoid with its active form being retinol. Retinol is necessary for the formation of rhodopsin, a pigment used by rods. Rods are most active in situations with dim illumination. Less rhodopsin results in fewer rods being able to respond in low levels of light causing prolonged dark adaption. &#10;&#10;Vitamin D plays a significant role in regulating calcium and phosphate levels within the body. A major source of Vitamin D is sunlight, however, UV exposure can increase the risk of skin cancer. UV light converts Vitamin D to its active form allowing for greater absorption of calcium in the gut. The calcium is then deposited into the bones, teeth etc. Dietary forms of Vitamin D include; butter, eggs, margarine, fish liver oil and fortified milk and juice. &#10;&#10;Vitamin C (Ascorbic acid) is water-soluble and stored in white blood cells.

      "options": [" 0.55; normal  ", " 1.76; abnormal   ", " 0.55; abnormal  ", " 1.76; normal  "],
      "answers": [" 1.76; abnormal   "],
      "explanation": "An electrooculogram uses the electrically positive cornea and electrically negative back of the eye to measure the standing potential between the two regions. The readings reflect the activity and integrity of the photoreceptors and retinal pigmented epithelium; therefore, retinal diseases that affect this area will lead to a reduction in the signal produced. The test is performed in both light and dark adapted states. Interpretation of the results involves measuring the maximal height of the potential in the light and minimal height of the potential in the dark. The Arden ratio can then be calculated by dividing the light peak value by the dark trough value. Normal values are above 1.85. &#10;&#10;For the above case, the light peak is 7.4 and dark trough is 4.2. &#10;7.4/4.2 = 1.76 &#10;1.76 is below 1.85; therefore the ratio may be considered abnormal."

      "answers": [" 4.5mm from the foveal pit   "],
      "explanation": "In the human fovea there are no rod photoreceptors present; cones are the only photoreceptors in this area, and they are perfectly arranged in a hexagonal mosaic pattern. Outside of the foveal region, the rod photoreceptors are introduced, breaking up this tight hexagonal cone packing. However, this architecture is still very organized, as cones are rather evenly spaced around the rods. Cone density rapidly falls outside of the fovea and remains at a steady density in the peripheral retina. As the cone density rapidly declines, the rod photoreceptor density quickly increases to a peak density in a ring around the fovea (also known as the 'rod ring'). This is located about 4.5mm from the center of the fovea (or 18 degrees from the foveal pit)."

      "answers": [" 9-13 days   "],
      "explanation": "Photoreceptor disc production begins in the cell body. The rough endoplasmic reticulum produces proteins which are then packaged by the Golgi apparatus. This complex then moves up through the inner segment to the base of the outer segment. The discs become free-floating in rod cells. The discs move up slowly until they are shed and phagocytized by the retinal epithelial pigment cells. On average, rods shed about 10% of their discs per day. Rods tend to shed their discs during the day while cones get rid of their discs at night."

      "explanation": "The presence of a pigmented demarcation line at the junction of flat and detached retina in cases of a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (along with other features) can aid in determining the length of time the retinal detachment has been present. These demarcation lines (also known as 'high water marks') occur due to the proliferation of retinal pigment epithelial cells and commonly take about 3 months to develop. Their configuration is usually convex with respect to the ora serrata and represents sites of increased adhesion. With time, the demarcation line tends to lose its pigment and can be less obvious upon fundus examination."

      "explanation": "Recent studies have demonstrated a correlation between blue-violet light that lies within the range of 415nm-455nm and the development of macular degeneration. Excessive exposure to light that falls within this bandwidth is associated with death of the retinal pigment epithelial cells. However, blue-turquoise light (465-495nm) does not appear to possess detrimental effects to ocular health. Blue-turquoise light is important in activation of the pupillary reflex as well as management of the circadian sleep/wake cycle. There is increasing evidence that compact fluorescent lamps, LED lights as well as sunlight all transmit blue-violet light, which over time may be linked with retinal damage."

Some texts quote that the resting potential of an unstimulated photoreceptor cell is -20 mV, others state -50 mV whereas others quote -40 mV. Regardless of the value, the important thing to note is that normal cells have resting potentials of around -70 mV which is more negative than photoreceptors. This fact is attributable to the dark current which makes a photoreceptor's resting potential slightly more positive. &#10;Reference: Dowling, J.

      "answers": [" Decreased night vision   "],
      "explanation": "PRP may cause decreased peripheral vision and poor night vision because, depending on the extent of the treatment, photoreceptors (rods) in the mid-peripheral and para-central retina are destroyed. The patient may also experience a tritanopic (blue/yellow) color defect. This decrease in color vision has previously occurred to a much greater extent, as the argon laser used to treat the retina was composed of both short and medium wavelengths. The shorter wavelength is capable of causing greater damage, and is currently filtered during the procedure of PRP. ERG testing of a patient with proliferative diabetic retinopathy reveals a decrease in the amplitudes of the photopic and scotopic b waves."

      "answers": [" Free-floating discs in the outer segment   "],
      "explanation": "Cones and rods possess outer segments which consist of stacks of disc-like structures containing photopigment however, the discs of cones are not free-floating. The discs of cones remain attached as they migrate outwards. It was previously thought that only rods possessed a cilium but this has been proven to be inaccurate. Both rods and cones possess ciliary processes, inner segments, mitochondria and synaptic terminals. The synaptic terminals of rods differ in their morphology from cones in that they are slightly smaller and rounder and are called spherules while cones display a larger and flatter terminal called a pedicle."

      "options": [" Ascension phenomenon  ", " Photopsia  ", " Schafer's sign   ", " Cloquet's canal  "],
      "answers": [" Schafer's sign   "],
      "explanation": "Schafer's sign occurs when there is a release of pigment into the vitreal chamber. The excessive pigment may be noted by the patient as a sudden increase in floaters. This sign usually indicates the presence of a retinal tear because a break in the retina may release retinal pigment epithelium. Pigment in the vitreal chamber may also be associated with a posterior uveitis or trauma or can occur secondary to intraocular surgery. It is of vital importance when a patient enters your clinic complaining of a recent increase in floaters, especially monocularly, or if you visualize pigment in the vitreous, that you rule out a retinal tear. Remember, many patients who suffer from a retinal tear are asymptomatic. &#10;&#10;The ascension phenomenon describes the ability of the practitioner to better visualize vitreal cells or other suspended granules by asking the patient to move their eyes rapidly and then upon stabilization, using the slit lamp, the doctor waits and watches for cells or other details to move across the viewing beam. &#10;&#10;Photopsias are flashes of light that may be perceived by the patient during periods of retinal traction. &#10;&#10;Cloquet's canal is comprised of the primary vitreous, which develops from weeks 3 through 9. The secondary vitreous then begins to form and condenses the primary vitreous, producing Cloquet's canal."

      "answers": [" Pericyte   "],
      "explanation": "Pericytes are smooth muscle cells that are generally adhered to small blood vessels. They are found at the junction between arterioles and capillaries. Their muscle action alters the flow of blood through the retina's microcirculation. Pericytes are not found in the choroid. &#10;&#10;In poorly controlled diabetics, the pericytes become damaged causing leakage through the microvasculature as seen in diabetic retinopathy. &#10;&#10;Glial cells are non-neuronal cells that serve several functions, depending on the type of glial cell. On the whole, glial cells are responsible for structural and nutritional support as well as insulating and protecting neurons. &#10;&#10;Astrocytes are a type of glial cell that serve many functions including the potential to regulate blood flow, metabolic support, structural support of the neural cells and formation of the blood-brain barrier. &#10;&#10;Schwann cells are also a type of glial cell.

It has been described in up to 50% of patients and represents immune complex thrombi that close the blood vessel, causing a nerve layer infarction. It is also notable that cytomegalovirus retinitis is extremely common in patients with AIDS. Less likely, but also potentially causing retinal changes in patients who suffer from AIDS, are toxoplasmosis and syphilitic retinitis.

Cataract surgery is known to increase the risk for developing a retinal detachment, especially if any complications occur. Patients who are myopic are also more prone to a retinal detachment, with the higher degree of myopia, the higher the risk factor. Family history is also relevant in that there may be certain genetic factors that promote inflammation and photoreceptor degeneration, which can lead to an increased risk of a retinal detachment.

      "answers": [" Central serous retinopathy   "],
      "explanation": "Fluorescein angiography studies of patients with central serous retinopathy typically reveal a classic 'smoke-stack' presentation. This appearance is a result of leakage of fluorescein dye through the retinal pigment epithelium, which causes a small hyperfluorescent spot in the early stage of angiography. During the later venous stage, dye will continue to pass into the subretinal space, where it ascends vertically to the upper limit of the detachment before extending laterally until the entire subretinal space is filled with fluorescein. &#10;&#10;Patients with cystoid macular edema will reveal a 'flower-petal' pattern of hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography studies. This is caused by the accumulation of the fluorescein dye inside the microcystic spaces that have developed within the retina. &#10;&#10;Classic choroidal neovascular membranes will show a well-defined membrane that fills with fluorescein in the early phase, creating a lacy appearance. The dye will then eventually leak after 1-2 minutes into the subretinal space surrounding the neovascular membrane."

      "answers": [" Atherosclerosis-related thrombus formation   "],
      "explanation": "The most common cause of a central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is atherosclerosis-related thrombus formation at the level of the lamina cribrosa. This etiology accounts for close to 80% of all cases. The presence and severity of atherosclerosis increases with age and is accelerated by hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, smoking, and a sedentary lifestyle. Vascular changes that are characteristic of atherosclerotic disease include focal arterial wall thickening (as a result of the accumulation of lipid-containing foam cells) and increased thickness of smooth muscle and collagen layers. These features can eventually completely impede the flow of blood through the artery, leading to ischemia of the tissue it supplies. &#10;&#10;Other more common causes of an artery occlusion include cholesterol emboli (Hollenhorst plaques); however, these are often located in the area of smaller arteriole bifurcations and rarely cause significant obstruction of retinal arterioles. Fibrin-platelet emboli appear as dull, grey, elongated particles that may occasionally fill the entire lumen of a retinal artery. They are a common cause of transient ischemic attacks, in which vision loss usually only lasts a couple of minutes and rarely cause a complete obstruction of the central retinal artery. The most dangerous type of embolus is a calcific emboli, which typically originates from atheromatous plaques, or calcified heart valves. These plaques are more likely to cause permanent occlusion of the central retinal artery or one of its branches. &#10;&#10;Other less common causes of retinal arterial occlusive disease are giant cell arteritis, cardiac embolism, periarteritis nodosa, thrombophilic disorders, and sickling hemoglobinopathies."

In some cases, patients may benefit from laser photocoagulation procedures; however, this is typically unsuccessful in cases where the macula is significantly ischemic. &#10;&#10;Neovascularization of the disc and retina can also occur following a branch retinal vein occlusion, typically presenting at the border of the ischemic retina drained by the occluded retinal vein. Neovascularization can be a serious complication if it leads to recurrent vitreous or pre-retinal hemorrhages; in some cases, a tractional retinal detachment can develop."

      "options": [" Collagen  ", " Water   ", " Hyalocytes  ", " Proteins  "],
      "answers": [" Water   "],
      "explanation": "The vitreous humor is a thick gel-like substance that fills the vitreous cavity, which constitutes about 60% of the globe. The vitreous contains elements that are important for retinal health. The ionic composition of the vitreous includes oxygen, water, sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphate, glucose and proteins (although the blood-vitreal barrier blocks the majority of proteins from getting into the vitreous). The vitreous composition is roughly 99% water."

      "answers": [" Color vision   "],
      "explanation": "Patients diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) will demonstrate a normal response on color vision testing due to the fact that this retinal disease preferentially affects the rod photoreceptors; the cones are typically left intact for the most part. Therefore, color vision is usually spared. &#10;&#10;In early stages of RP, electroretinography testing will reveal both reduced scotopic rod and combined responses. As the disease progresses, photopic responses will also become reduced; eventually, the ERG will become completely extinguished. &#10;&#10;Electrooculography testing also produces an abnormal response in which there is an absence of the light rise. &#10;&#10;Dark adaptometry studies in patients with RP will reveal prolonged dark adaptation: this can be helpful in early diagnosis of the condition if the diagnosis is uncertain. &#10;&#10;Classic visual field defects in patients with RP demonstrates an annular scotoma in the mid-periphery in the early stages that eventually expands both centrally and peripherally. Eventually, a tiny island of central vision may be all that is spared, and in severe cases, this may also become extinguished."

      "options": [" Cotton wool spots  ", " Dot/blot hemorrhages  ", " Neovascularization of the disc   ", " Peripheral hard exudates  ", " Venous tortuosity/beading  "],
      "answers": [" Neovascularization of the disc   "],
      "explanation": "Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) is divided into three categories: mild NPDR, moderate NPDR, and severe NPDR. Mild NDPR is associated with hard exudates (away from the macular region), microaneurysms, and isolated dot/blot hemorrhages. Moderate NPDR occurs when there is a greater degree of ischemia and vascular leakage, which manifests as an increase in the number of hemorrhages, venous beading/tortuosity, or cotton wool spots, and/or the presence of intra-retinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA). Severe NPDR is a worsening of moderate NPDR, with dot/blot hemorrhages and microaneurysms seen in all four quadrants of the eye, in addition to venous beading in at least two quadrants, and IRMA in at least one quadrant. &#10;&#10;Proliferative diabetic retinopathy occurs with pre-retinal new blood vessel growth and proliferation. Neovascularization may be evaluated at the optic nerve (neovascularization of the disc), greater than 1 disc diameter away from the disc (neovascularization elsewhere), and/or new blood vessel growth at the iris (rubeosis iridis). PDR is also associated with large pre-retinal hemorrhages (keel or boat-shaped) and proliferation of fibrovascular tissue that may lead to retinal detachments upon contraction. &#10;&#10;Reference: Wolf, S., Kirchhof, B. and Reim, M.

      "answers": [" Hyperpolarization   "],
      "explanation": "When enough photons of light are absorbed, a series of events occur, leading to a closure of sodium channels in the outer segments of the photoreceptors. Ultimately, this results in hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor's membrane. The membrane potential changes from -40 mV in the dark to -60 mV in response to light. Some texts quote that the resting potential of an unstimulated photoreceptor cell is -20 mV; others state -50 mV, whereas others quote -40 mV. Regardless of the value, the important thing to note is that normal cells have resting potentials of around -70 mV which is more negative than that of photoreceptors. This fact is attributable to the dark current which make photoreceptor's resting potential slightly more positive."

      "answers": [" Tapetum lucidum   "],
      "explanation": "The tapetum lucidum, commonly found in nocturnal vertebrate animals (not present in humans or swine), is an additional retinal layer that has a highly reflective, iridescent appearance. The function of this layer is to reflect light back onto the retina in the exact same path that it was originally oriented. As light passes the rod and cone photoreceptors, it reflects off of the tapetum lucidum, which then allows the light to pass through the photoreceptors yet again. This effectively amplifies the light several fold, significantly enhancing visual sensitivity during low light conditions. This layer is what causes an animal's eyes to shine or glow in the dark."

      ],
      "answers": [" Due to the fact that ganglion cells have receptive fields that are center-surround  "],
      "explanation": "The majority of ganglion cells possess center-surround receptive fields and therefore exhibit lateral inhibition. This property serves to increase spatial resolution. The receptive fields can be either center on or center off. The receptive field appears like a donut, with the center being excited by light and the surrounding annulus inhibited by light or vice versa. Increasing the size of the stimulus causes summation of both parts of the receptive fields, resulting in a greater reduction in the frequency of action potentials than if the center were to be stimulated alone."

      "answers": [" Duration of diabetes   "],
      "explanation": "When it comes to the development of diabetic retinopathy, the most important risk factor is the duration of diabetes. Studies have shown that diabetic retinopathy rarely manifests within the first 5 years of onset of the disease. In patients diagnosed prior to the age of 30, there is a 50% incidence of diabetic retinopathy after 10 years, and a 90% occurrence rate after 30 years. Additionally, the duration of diabetes is also the strongest predictor for diabetic maculopathy and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. &#10;&#10;Another very important risk factor for the development of diabetic retinopathy is metabolic control of the disease. It has been shown that early and tight control of blood glucose levels can delay or even prevent development or progression of the condition, while elevated serum glucose levels are associated with an increased risk of diabetic retinopathy. &#10;&#10;Other factors include pregnancy, hypertension, nephropathy, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and anemia.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Diabetic Retinopathy"

      "options": [" Ehlers-Danlos syndrome  ", " Marfan syndrome  ", " Pseudoxanthoma elasticum   ", " Paget's disease  ", " Sickle cell disease  "],
      "answers": [" Pseudoxanthoma elasticum   "],
      "explanation": "Approximately 50% of patients who present with angioid streaks have an associated systemic disease; the other 50% of cases are considered idiopathic. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is by far the most commonly associated systemic disease in these patients. In general, PXE is a rather uncommon, inherited, generalized connective tissue disorder whereby tissues in the body containing elastin are significantly affected. Up to 85% of patients with PXE will develop ocular complications, usually after the second decade of life. The combination of PXE and ocular involvement with angioid streaks is referred to as 'Gronblad-Strandberg syndrome.' Patients with PXE typically have characteristic signs of very loose skin folds and yellow skin papules that are commonly observed in the neck region, axillae, and on flexor aspects of joints. These patients also frequently suffer from cardiovascular disease caused by accelerated atherosclerosis and have an increased risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeds, which can be life-threatening. &#10;&#10;Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is another systemic condition that is occasionally associated with the presence of angioid streaks. It is a rare, usually dominantly inherited disorder of collagen in the body that is caused by a deficiency of hydroxylysine. Systemic features include thin, hyperelastic skin, hyperextensible joints, cardiovascular disease, and other systemic lesions. Besides angioid streaks, patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can also develop other ocular conditions such as lens subluxation, blue sclera, high myopia, keratoconus and retinal detachments. &#10;&#10;Angioid streaks also occur in about 2-10% of patients diagnosed with Paget disease. Paget disease is a chronic, progressive (inherited in some cases) disease that is characterized by an enlarged skull, bone pain, frequent bone fractures, hearing loss, and cardiovascular complications. The disease may be localized to a few bones or may be generalized. In some cases, patients are even asymptomatic; however, in late stages, significant vision loss can ensue due to optic nerve compression from enlarging bone. Lab testing in these patients will show an increased serum alkaline phosphatase and urine calcium level. &#10;&#10;Less common systemic disorders that may cause the formation of angioid streaks include sickle-cell disease, acromegaly, senile elastosis, lead poisoning, and Marfan syndrome."

It also has a gender predominance of females over males. Obesity, which contributes to a more severe disease condition, and smoking are modifiable. There is increasing evidence that nutrition plays a role, with Omega 3 fatty acid intake associated with lower risk. Based on the AREDS vitamins studies, several vitamin supplements have become available. Omega 3 fatty acids are now being studied prospectively, as are the carotenoids lutein, zeaxanthin, and possibly astaxanthin. The consumption of green leafy vegetables and a diet that is plant-based has potential for prevention and mediation of severity as well."

These flashes can be elicited be the acceleration of the eye or head. It is thought that these light flashes are associated with vitreoretinal traction, which leads to activation of photoreceptors as the vitreous tugs or pulls on the retina. &#10;&#10;The flickering of light that precedes a migraine is known as a scintillating scotoma (or visual aura). &#10;&#10;A phosphene is a perception of light that occurs when pressure is applied to the globe. &#10;&#10;A Dictionary of Hallucinations.

Xanthophyll is a combination of two carotenoids: zeaxanthin and lutein. Xanthophyll shows spectral selectivity for blue light, a characteristic that helps to decrease the potential formation of free radicals. Current research suggests that xanthophyll becomes depleted in people who suffer from macular degeneration. Unfortunately, xanthophyll is not synthesized by the body and thus it is advised that those diagnosed with macular degeneration take oral supplements to aid in maintaining xanthophyll pigment levels."

Myopia greater than 8 diopters or patients with an axial length greater than 24mm have been shown to be at an increased risk for detachments as well. Studies have also shown a greater incidence of retinal detachments in patients who are aphakic; this typically occurs within the first year following surgery.

      "explanation": "Clinically significant macular edema is the leading cause of visual impairment in patients suffering from retinopathy associated with diabetes. &#10;&#10;The presence of at least one of the following retinal observations indicates a diagnosis of clinically significant macular edema: &#10;- Retinal edema occurring within 500 microns of the center of the macula &#10;- Hard exudates occurring within 500 microns of the center of the macula if there is associated retinal thickening (which may be outside of the 500 micron distance) &#10;- Retinal edema that is at least 1 disc diameter in size and in which any part is within 1 disc diameter of the center of the macula &#10;&#10;This characterization of clinically significant macular edema is important because these retinal findings represent the need for consideration of retinal treatment (either photodynamic therapy or anti-VEGF injections), irrespective of the level of visual acuity. Studies have proven that laser photocoagulation procedures performed on these patients can reduce the risk of vision loss by up to 50%."

      "answers": [" Vitrosin   "],
      "explanation": "Vitrosin is a very unique collagen that is capable of binding large amounts of water (up to two hundred times its weight!). Vitrosin originates from neuroectoderm. There was originally some debate as to whether or not vitrosin was truly a type of collagen due to the fact that it contains a complex polysaccharide within its matrix from which it cannot be separated. However, it was later ruled to be a type of collagen because it contains hydroxyproline (which is specific to collagen) and presents with the same diffractive properties as collagen. &#10;&#10;Hemoglobin and albumin are proteins found in blood. Creatine is a compound used as an energy source, primarily by our muscles."

      "answers": [" High myopia   "],
      "explanation": "It has been seen in myopic patients, (particularly highly myopic subjects) that myopia may serve as a protective factor against the progression of retinopathy associated with diabetes. Axial elongation, posterior vitreous detachment, altered ocular blood flow and vitreous syneresis are all more commonly observed in patients with high myopia. Proliferation of diabetic retinopathy can be triggered by traction of the retina caused by incomplete detachment of the vitreous, which may lead to fibrovascular tissue formation. Myopic patients with a posterior vitreous detachment possess a decreased risk of traction and therefore a decreased risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. &#10;&#10;Concurrent systemic conditions such as elevated cholesterol or hypertension may serve to exacerbate retinopathy, as can a high body mass index. To date, a link with iris color and diabetic retinopathy has not been established. &#10;&#10;Are myopic eyes less likely to have diabetic retinopathy? Lim LS, Lamoureux E, Saw SM, et al.

      "answers": [" Calcific plaques   "],
      "explanation": "Calcific plaques, although rare, pose the greatest risk of causing a CRAO or a branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO). These plaques occur secondarily to damage to the heart valves, causing them to become brittle and break off. Calcific plaques are very hard and do not alter in shape or size, thereby impeding blood flow and causing ischemia. Hollenhorst plaques are comprised of cholesterol and commonly dissolve. Hollenhorst plaques are refractile, and appear larger than the vessel in which they occupy due to their shiny presentations. They commonly lodge transiently at vessel bifurcations. Fibrinoplatelet plaques are composed of aggregations of fibrin and platelets. On occasion, fibrinoplatelet plaques may dissolve on their own. Talc emboli, seen in patients who inject drugs intravenously, may also cause a CRAO, however they do not pose the greatest risk for an occlusion when compared to the above etiologies. &#10;&#10;Reference: Agarwal, A and Jacob, S.

      "explanation": "A central scotoma may be attributable to macular disease or an optic nerve disease, especially those that also affect the papillomacular bundle. Any pathology that affects the integrity of the macula generally is associated with a loss of visual acuity (the severity varies with the amount of destruction). Optic nerve disease such as optic neuritis may also cause a central scotoma. Further testing such as acuity, pupil reflexes, and color vision will help to discern whether the origin is macular or optic nerve related.

      "explanation": "The configuration of subretinal fluid in cases of a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is relevant in that it is determined by gravitational forces, the anatomical limits of the eye (ora serrata and optic nerve), and the location of the primary retinal break. Therefore, the conformation of the retinal detachment can aid in determining the suspected location for the offending retinal break, if it is not initially observed. For example, if the retinal break occurs superiorly, the subretinal fluid will first migrate inferiorly on the same side as the break and then will eventually spread superiorly on the opposite side. In the case of the above patient, when the retinal detachment is inferior and the subretinal fluid is higher on one side; therefore, the site of the retinal break is likely to be located inferiorly on that same side."

      "options": [" Inferior-nasal  ", " Superior-nasal  ", " Superior-temporal   ", " Inferior-temporal  "],
      "answers": [" Superior-temporal   "],
      "explanation": "Retinal breaks leading to the formation of retinal detachments are most commonly found in the superior-temporal region, especially in cases of total retinal detachments or those affecting the macula, due to the nature of gravitational forces. Superior-nasal tears are the next most commonly observed. Additionally, the most likely cause of a retinal detachment is vitreoretinal traction at the attachment of the vitreous base, which leads to a retinal tear as the vitreous detaches from this area; fluid then enters the subretinal space at the site of the tear, resulting in a detachment of the retina. &#10;&#10;The patient history may also provide a clue to the location of the break. When detachments progress rather quickly, the break is usually large and found superiorly closer to the equator than to the ora. Small, inferior, or extremely peripheral tears usually result in much slower progression. The quadrant of visual field loss that is first detected is also valuable in locating the primary retinal break.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Retinal Detachments"

This retinal finding typically manifests several hours after the artery obstruction and usually gradually subsides in the following weeks. The appearance of the bright red central spot is due to the fact that the macular region is supplied with blood from the underlying choroid, which remains unaffected in a central retinal artery occlusion because it is supplied by the posterior ciliary arteries. This macular area particularly stands out against the surrounding pale retina that is ischemic as a result of the occlusion."

The choroid supplies the outer retina with nutrients, accounting for about 85% of total blood flow of the eye. In order for the choroid to supply the retina with these nutrients, the vessels must be able to allow the molecules to pass through. Additionally, in the ciliary processes, the fenestrated capillaries create oncotic pressure due to protein leakage through the vessels that allows for aqueous production through the process of ultrafiltration. &#10;&#10;Non-fenestrated capillaries of the retina and iris are essential for the formation of the blood-aqueous and blood-retinal barriers. &#10;&#10;Ocular Therapeutics (3rd edition).

The least common and most severe form of RP is due to an x-linked genetic mutation and commonly results in complete blindness by the time patients are in their 20's or 30's."

      "answers": [" Pigment epithelial detachment   "],
      "explanation": "Areas of hyperfluorescence that appear during fluorescein angiography occur due to either an absolute increase in the amount of fluorescein in the retinal tissues or as a result of enhanced visualization of a normal quantity of fluorescein in the fundus. Conditions that can lead to hyperfluorescence include leakage of dye from abnormal choroidal vasculature (such as a choroidal neovascular membrane), abnormal retinal neovascularization (as in proliferative diabetic retinopathy), or breakdown of the inner blood-retinal barrier (cystoid macular edema). Hyperflourescence also occurs as a result of pooling of fluorescein secondary to breakdown of the outer blood-retinal barrier in such conditions as central serous retinopathy and pigment epithelial detachments. A transmission (or window) defect caused by an absence or atrophy of the RPE results in unmasking of normal background choroidal fluorescence, leading to the appearance of hyperfluorescent areas. &#10;&#10;Hypofluorescent regions on fluorescein angiography are due to either obstruction (masking) of normal density of fluorescein in the retinal tissue (blood, hard exudates, increased density of RPE, or choroidal nevi) or inadequate perfusion of the retinal tissue (vascular occlusion, or loss of the vascular bed)."

The predominant carotenoids that make up this macular pigment include lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin (which is a conversion product of lutein). They are selectively concentrated in the macula lutea and are responsible for the yellow appearance of this region. Humans cannot synthesize these pigments de novo; therefore, they must be derived entirely from the diet. Certain eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) have been associated with low levels of lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin."

      "explanation": "CSR is more commonly seen in middle-aged males under high-stress, high anxiety, or with type A personalities. This condition causes fluid to leak from the choriocapillaries into the subretinal area, causing a serous detachment of the neurosensory retina. There is an associated loss of the foveal reflex, a hyperopic shift, a potential relative scotoma, and metamorphopsia. Flourescein angiography will reveal hyperfluorescence that appears like a smoke-stack. Evaluation of the posterior pole will typically display a blister-like elevation of the neurosensory retina. The patient is monitored monthly and intervention is rarely required, as most cases of CSR will resolve within roughly 6 months."

It usually occurs as a unilateral, solitary lesion that is most commonly found in the temporal equatorial region of the fundus. In some cases, depigmented lacunae may be observed within the lesion, or a lighter pigmented halo may occur just within the border of the lesion. Because CHRPEs are composed RPE cells, they will not disappear with red-free light in the way that choroidal lesions do. &#10;&#10;A melanocytoma is a rare tumor that typically occurs at the optic nerve head.

The B-wave occurs due to the responses from bipolar and Mueller cells. The C-wave is created by responses from retinal pigment epithelial cells, and the D-wave is attributable to activity of the OFF bipolar cells. The C-wave and the D-wave are not used clinically very often because they are susceptible to being obscured by blinking of the eye. It is also noteworthy that oscillations seen in the B-wave are due to responses of the amacrine cells."

Visual field testing may show an absolute scotoma corresponding to the area of the retinoschisis. &#10;&#10;Retinoschisis is different from a retinal detachment, which is the separation of the neurosensory retina from the RPE. This separation usually takes place between the RPE and photoreceptor layer. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can assist in differentiating retinoschisis from a retinal detachment. The OCT scan of a retinal detachment would show a separation of the full thickness neurosensory retina from the RPE. On the other hand, a scan of retinoschisis would show a split within the neurosensory retina.

      "explanation": "Cilioretinal arteries are most frequently a result of an anomalous direct or indirect branch of the posterior ciliary arteries. In some cases, they can also arise from the peripapillary choroid. Cilioretinal arteries are typically observed as emerging from the temporal aspect of the optic disc, separately from the central retinal artery. The incidence of occurrence varies from 6-25% in the relevant literature. A cilioretinal artery has been said to be a possible protective feature that allows for a secondary route of blood flow to the macula in the event of a central retinal artery occlusion. &#10;&#10;Optociliary shunt vessels are venous communications between the retinal and choroidal circulations; these vessels occur on the disc surface when there is impaired venous outflow through the retinal vein. &#10;&#10;Situs inversus is a congenital vascular anomaly found at the optic disc, where the retinal vessels have followed an abnormal course. They enter the disc temporally and proceed towards the nasal retina before turning back and coursing out to the temporal retina. &#10;&#10;An arteriovenous anastomosis of the retina is an abnormal communication between an artery and vein that occurs through collateral channels.

The optic nerve typically appears more oval in shape and the superior pole of the axis appears to be rotated (most commonly infero-nasally). Due to the oblique entry of the optic nerve, there tends to be an associated elevation of the neuroretinal rim tissue and indistinct disc margins, depending on the direction of rotation. &#10;&#10;Optociliary shunt vessels are abnormal venous communications between the retinal and choroidal vasculature that occur on the surface of the optic disc.

Patients suffering from an ischemic CRVO have a much poorer prognosis as compared to non-ischemic types, due to the development of macular ischemia and secondary neovascular glaucoma. Pan-retinal photocoagulation treatment is usually performed in patients with associated rubeosis iridis."

      "explanation": "Research has demonstrated that lifestyle choices such as smoking, a high body mass index, increased ultraviolet exposure and a poor diet all increase the chances of developing macular degeneration. Smoking alone increases the risk of developing macular degeneration up to 16 to 20 times. The main risk factor for the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is increasing age. Other important risk factors include positive family history of AMD, Caucasian race, and the presence of age-related maculopathy (especially when associated with soft drusen). &#10;&#10;Review of Optometry.

      "explanation": "In the macula, cone photoreceptors are densely packed in a hexagonal arrangement. As the location moves peripherally in the retina, the size and separation of the cone photoreceptors grow, and rods fill in the spaces between cones. This organization of the photoreceptor mosaic represents an optimum arrangement for efficient visual processing under a wide range of stimulus conditions."

        " Nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer  "
      ],
      "answers": [" Photoreceptor layer and retinal pigment epithelium   "],
      "explanation": "A retinal detachment with surrounding subretinal fluid represents a separation of the neuroretina (photoreceptors) and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The classic pathogenesis of a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment usually begins with vitreous liquefaction, followed by a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and a subsequent retinal tear at the site of significant vitreoretinal adhesion. Liquid in the vitreous cavity then passes through the retinal break and enters the subretinal space. &#10;&#10;It is important to note that the majority of patients with retinal breaks do not typically develop retinal detachments because there are several normal physiological forces that work to keep the retina in place. These forces are a result of several factors: the presence of an interphotoreceptor matrix in the subretinal space, differences in the oncotic pressure between the choroid and subretinal space, hydrostatic forces related to intraocular pressure, and the metabolic transfer of fluid and ions by the RPE. A retinal detachment however, will occur when the combination of factors that promote the development of a retinal detachment overwhelm the normal physiologic attachment forces."

      "explanation": "Photoreceptors of the retina have many characteristics that are unlike most other neurological cells in the human body. For example, photoreceptors produce graded potentials in which the signal varies in intensity; this is in contrast to action potentials, which display an all-or-none response. Additionally, photoreceptors hyperpolarize in response to light. Therefore, bright light will lead to a greater degree of hyperpolarization, whereas dim light produces less hyperpolarization. When hyperpolarization of a photoreceptor occurs, the cell releases less of its neurotransmitter (glutamate). Therefore, photoreceptors release a greater amount of glutamate while in darkness. &#10;&#10;Discovering Biological Psychology (2nd edition). Freberg, L.A. 2010. Wadsworth Cengage Learning.

      "explanation": "The vitreous humor is a thick gel-like substance that fills the vitreous cavity which constitutes about 60% of the globe. The vitreous contains elements that are important for retinal health. The ionic composition includes oxygen, water, sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphate, glucose, and proteins (although the blood-vitreal barrier blocks the majority of proteins from getting into the vitreous).

      "explanation": "Anterior PHPV, also known as persistent fetal vasculature, occurs from a failure of the hyaloid artery system to regress along with hyperplasia of the primary vitreous, forming a dense mass on the posterior surface of the lens and extremely poor vision. Associated findings include leukocoria, a shallow anterior chamber, cataracts, micro-ophthalmia, elongated ciliary processes and colobomas of the uveal tract. Potential complications include glaucoma and very dense amblyopia. Treatment requires early removal of the lens and management of any glaucoma and amblyopia.

      "answers": [" Posterior vitreous detachment   "],
      "explanation": "Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments are caused by a full-thickness retinal break in which liquid vitreous is allowed to enter the subretinal space and separate the neuroretina from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The most common cause of a rhegmatogenous detachment is a retinal tear at the site of a vitreoretinal adhesion during the advancement of a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). Factors that may put patients at higher risk of developing this condition include the presence of lattice degeneration and previous intraocular surgery. &#10;&#10;Tractional retinal detachments are not associated with retinal breaks but are due to tractional forces secondary to a diseased vitreous. The most common cause of tractional retinal detachments is proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Occasionally, patients with a tractional retinal detachment can develop retinal tears, leading to a combined tractional/rhegmatogenous detachment. &#10;&#10;Exudative retinal detachments occur as a result of breakdown of the blood-retinal barriers or the RPE due to choroidal or retinal disease.

      "answers": [" Watzke-Allen test   "],
      "explanation": "The most effective and sensitive method of evaluating a suspected macular hole is by use of optical coherence tomography (OCT); however, many general optometric practices do not have this instrument available in the their offices. Another helpful clinical test that is utilized to assess for a suspected full thickness macular hole is the Watzke-Allen slit lamp test. A narrow vertical slit-beam of light is placed over the foveal region using the slit-lamp and condensing lens. The patient is then asked to describe the line of light. The test is considered positive if the patient reports a break or significant thinning of the bar of light. Most patients with a full-thickness macular hole will report a positive Watzke-Allen test. &#10;&#10;Amsler grid testing is great for macular disease in that it is sensitive for detecting the presence of macular lesions; however, it is not specific to the type of lesion that may be present."

      "answers": [" Recovery of visual acuity within 60 seconds or less   "],
      "explanation": "The macular photostress test can be useful to differentiate between macular and optic nerve dysfunction in the event of decreased best corrected acuity. The test is administered monocularly by projecting one line larger than the best corrected visual acuity. Spectacle or contact lens correction is then removed and the patient dark adapts for one minute. With the symptomatic eye occluded, a penlight or transilluminator is held roughly 3 cm from the eye, and the patient is asked to fixate on the light source for 10 seconds. Best correction is then replaced and the patient is asked to focus on the projected line until it can be read clearly again. A photostress test is considered normal if acuity is recovered within 60 seconds or less. Recovery time is expected to increase in patients over the age of 40. In the event of macular function disruption, visual recovery will be prolonged, or there will be a significantly large recovery difference between the eyes. &#10;&#10;Reference: Levin, L.

      "answers": [" Clear   "],
      "explanation": "As a whole, the retina is clear. This is an important property as light must pass through eight layers prior to being absorbed by the photoreceptors. If the retina did possess a color, this would interfere with the absorption of light of specific wavelengths. The vasculature behind the retina gives the perception, in general, of an overall pink/red hue. A detached retina or a dead retina will appear white. The choroid can appear as different colors based upon skin pigmentation, but the retina itself does not vary in color."

      "question": "Midget ganglion cells receive information pre-synaptically from which cells?",
      "options": [" Rod bipolar cells  ", " Midget bipolar cells   ", " Flat bipolar cells  ", " Horizontal bipolar cells  "],
      "answers": [" Midget bipolar cells   "],
      "explanation": "Midget bipolar cells synapse onto midget ganglion cells. These are very selective and exclusive channels as one cone cell synapses with one midget bipolar cell which then in turn relays the information to a midget ganglion cell. There is no additional input from other cells or synapses. These types of monosynaptic cells are most common in the central retina thus explaining the ability to visually discern fine details. &#10;&#10;Flat bipolar cells receive information from many cone cells and in turn synapse with many ganglion cells. &#10;&#10;Rod bipolar cells, as their name suggests, convey information from many rod cells to several ganglion cells. Rods relay information only to rod bipolar cells."

      "options": [" Rod cells  ", " Cone cells  ", " Amacrine cells   ", " Bipolar cells  ", " Ganglion cells  "],
      "answers": [" Amacrine cells   "],
      "explanation": "Both amacrine and horizontal cells laterally integrate information, that is, they summate information horizontally across the retina rather than linearly across different layers. Ganglion, bipolar and photoreceptor cells transmit information across layers and not within them. Amacrine cells amalgamate information from ganglion and bipolar cells. There are at least 35 different types of amacrine cells. &#10;&#10;Horizontal cell bodies are located at the outer edge of the inner nuclear layer and combine information from rods and cones. There are at least two or three different types of horizontal cells."

      "answers": [" Sickle cell anemia   "],
      "explanation": "Sea fan retinopathy is characterized by abnormal, new blood vessel growth in the retina that occurs in association with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies. The anomalous red blood cell shape in sickle cell anemia, along with the increased rigidity of these red blood cells can result in obstruction of small peripheral retinal blood vessels. The occlusion of retinal arteries can cause retinal ischemia, particularly in the peripheral retina, that may lead to the development of arteriovenous anastomoses of pre-existent capillary channels. In some cases, sprouting of new blood vessels from these anastomoses can result, leading to the classic 'sea-fan' configuration that is characteristic of retinopathy associated with sickle cell anemia. In more severe cases, the abnormal new blood vessel growth can continue to proliferate and cause bleeding into the vitreous, or even worse, retinal detachment due to associated fibrovascular proliferation."

      "options": [" Sattler's layer  ", " Tapetum lucidum   ", " Muller cells of the retina  ", " Choroid  "],
      "answers": [" Tapetum lucidum   "],
      "explanation": "The tapetum lucidum is a highly reflective layer that is found in the majority of animals and is located just external to the retina in the upper half of the posterior aspect of the globe. The function of this layer is to reflect incoming light back onto the retina so as to increase the amount of light absorbed by the retinal layer; this enhances vision, particularly in low-light conditions. &#10;&#10;Sattler's layer is a division of the choroidal stroma and contains small caliber blood vessels. &#10;&#10;The choroid is a highly vascular layer that lies external to the retina. This darkly pigmented layer aids in the absorption of stray light, which serves to enhance visual acuity. The choroid also has an important role in nourishment of the retina. &#10;&#10;Muller cell processes extend throughout the length of the retina except the retinal pigment epithelium. Their cell bodies are found in the inner nuclear layer. Muller cells, along with segments of the photoreceptors, create tight junctions and serve to form the external limiting membrane. &#10;&#10;Reference: &#10;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14738502"

      "options": [" Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy  ", " Optical coherence tomography  ", " Scanning laser polarimetry   ", " Confocal scanning laser tomography  "],
      "answers": [" Scanning laser polarimetry   "],
      "explanation": "Birefringence is the splitting of a light ray (or wave) into two components as it passes through an anisotropic material. In an anisotropic material, the index of refraction is dependent on the direction of light within the material. There are several components of the ocular structure that can be considered birefringent, including the cornea, lens, and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). The basis of measuring RNFL thickness in a scanning laser polarimeter (such as the GDx VCC) is due to the birefringent properties of the RNFL. The RNFL is composed of highly ordered parallel axon bundles that contain microtubules and other cylindrical intracellular organelles that have a diameter smaller than the wavelength of light. This highly ordered structure is the source of birefringence of the RNFL. When light waves from the instrument are incident on the birefringent RNFL, the waves are split into two different components that travel at different velocities, creating a phase shift. This phase shift is also known as retardation and is directly proportional to the thickness of the RNFL. Because the cornea and lens are also considered birefringent structures, this instrument must compensate for the anterior segment birefringence in order to produce an accurate measure of the RNFL thickness."

      "question": "A retinal detachment in which vitreous contraction leads to the neurosensory retina being pulled away from the retinal pigment epithelium in the absence of a retinal break is known as which of the following?",

      "answers": [" Tractional retinal detachment   "],
      "explanation": "A tractional retinal detachment occurs secondary to the contraction of vitreoretinal membranes, which leads to the separation of the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Tractional retinal detachments occur in the absence of a retinal break or tear. &#10;&#10;Serous retinal detachments (also known as exudative or secondary retinal detachments) do not occur as a result of a retinal tear or retinal traction but as a result of subretinal fluid that accumulates between the neurosensory retina and RPE, leading to a separation of the tissue. This subretinal fluid is derived from the vessels of the neurosensory retina, the choroid, or in some cases, both. &#10;&#10;Cases in which there is a full thickness defect in the sensory retina that causes a detachment of the retina can be classified as a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (rhegma=break). In these cases, the retinal break permits liquefied vitreous fluid to gain access to the subretinal space, subsequently creating a separation of the tissue. &#10;&#10;There are some instances of a retinal detachment that can occur as a result of a combination of a retinal break and retinal traction. Typically, the retinal break is caused by tractional forces from an adjacent area of fibrovascular proliferation and contraction. This is most commonly observed in advanced cases of proliferative diabetic retinopathy."

      "answers": [" Square mirror / Oriented 180 degrees from the lesion   "],
      "explanation": "The Goldmann 3-mirror lens is comprised of a central Hruby lens surrounded by 3 viewing mirrors of different sizes and viewing angles, allowing for evaluation of different ocular structures. The central lens is a 64 diopter lens that is used for viewing of the posterior pole (also known as the Hruby lens). The smallest mirror is the bullet (or thumbnail) shaped mirror, which is used for examination of anterior chamber structures (angles) as well as the ora serrata, due to the angle that the mirror is positioned (59 degrees). The middle-sized lens is square-shaped and has a different angle of orientation (67 degrees) permitting the observation of the retina anterior to the equator or the peripheral retina. Lastly, the larger trapezoidal-shaped mirror is oriented such that it allows for viewing of the retina between the equator and the macula (73 degrees). &#10;&#10;Because these are mirrors, the location of the area that is examined is 180 degrees opposite from the position of the mirror. It is also helpful to understand that if the patient looks toward a mirror, the observer will view a less peripheral region of the retina. Mirrored lenses also posses a shallow depth of focus, which is valuable when a questionable retinal break cannot be clearly defined on ophthalmoscopy. &#10;&#10;Steidl, S, Hartnett, M.A. (2003).

      "explanation": "Juvenile Best disease, or vitelliform macular dystrophy, is a rare hereditary macular disease (autosomal dominant with variable penetrance) that typically presents in childhood or early adulthood. The progression of Best disease is very characteristic, as the appearance of the vitelliform lesions are classically grouped into 5 stages: &#10;- Stage 0 (pre-vitelliform): Children in this stage are usually asymptomatic and possess a normal fundus appearance; an electrooculogram (EOG) performed in this stage will reveal a subnormal result &#10;- Stage 1: Patients will begin to develop pigmentary mottling in the area of the macula &#10;- Stage 2 (vitelliform): This stage commonly begins in early childhood and typically does not impair visual acuity; the classic 'sunny-side up' egg yolk appearance in the area of the macula develops due to an accumulation of lipofuscin within the retinal pigment epithelium &#10;- Stage 3 (pseudo-hypopyon): This stage usually occurs near puberty in which part of the macular lesion becomes absorbed; over time, absorption may continue, and the entire lesion can become completely absorbed with minimal effect on vision &#10;- Stage 4 (vitelliruptive): Fundus examination in this stage will reveal the classic 'scrambled egg' appearance in which the vitelliform lesion begins to break up; visual acuity typically begins to drop as patients may develop fibrous scarring in the macular region, geographic atrophy, or a choroidal neovascular membrane (this usually occurs around the fifth decade)"

      "options": [" Superior temporal   ", " Inferior temporal  ", " Inferior nasal  ", " Superior nasal  "],
      "answers": [" Superior temporal   "],
      "explanation": "Branch retinal vein occlusions (BRVO) are the most common type of vascular occlusion encountered in clinic. Common associations include, but are not limited to: hypertension, diabetes, and congestive heart failure. The superior temporal vein is the most frequently involved, followed by the inferior temporal vein. The nasal quadrants are rarely involved. The pathogenesis of a BRVO results from compression of the vein by the overlying artery impeding blood flow return. The blood accumulates and eventually leaks out of the vessel, resulting in retinal hemorrhages. Some researchers have suggested that the superior temporal quadrant of the eye has the greatest amount of arterial/vein crossing junctions, and therefore possesses a higher likelihood of involvement. Visual acuity may be compromised, depending upon the presence of macular involvement. Greater amounts of ischemia increase the chances of complications such as neovascularization of the retina and rubeosis iridis. &#10;&#10;Reference: Joussen, A. Gardner, T and Kirchhof, G.

Retinal observations commonly include superficial, white, retinal patches resembling cotton-wool spots, pre-retinal and/or retinal hemorrhages, macular edema, dilated retinal veins, and possible optic disc edema or optic disc pallor. &#10;&#10;The underlying pathophysiology of the development of Purtscher's retinopathy is not fully understood; however, the classic mechanism proposes that the injury creates an intravascular hydrostatic shock wave that travels to the retinal vasculature and results in endothelial cell damage of the retinal veins, macular capillaries, and radial peripapillary capillaries. The problem with this theory is that it does not account for the development of this type of retinopathy in patients without a traumatic event (emboli, pancreatitis, connective tissue diseases, bone marrow transplantation, etc.). There is no known treatment for Purtscher's retinopathy except for proper management of the underlying cause. Prognosis for visual recovery is variable because, although retinal findings tend to resolve within a few weeks, about 50% of patients will experience persistent prolonged blurring of central vision due to irreversible macular or optic nerve damage. &#10;&#10;Terson syndrome occurs when a vitreous hemorrhage is accompanied by a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Commotio retinae appears as a grey-white discoloration of the retina that occurs following blunt ocular trauma. It is a result of the disruption of the photoreceptor outer-segments. This condition can present peripherally and may cause severe or permanent visual loss if damage occurs in the region of the macula."

      "answers": [" The a-wave will remain while the b-wave will disappear   "],
      "explanation": "A central retinal artery occlusion will cause a loss of the b-wave which is formed by responses from the bipolar and Muller cells, both of which are nourished by the central retinal artery. The a-wave results from excitation of the photoreceptors. The a-wave will not be lost in the event of a CRAO due to the fact that photoreceptors receive their oxygen supply via the choroid."

The nerves usually extend from the mid-equatorial region to the ora serrata along the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock meridians. The vortex vein ampullae are located in the four quadrants of the eye, with the number per quadrant varying between individuals. The posterior edge of the vortex vein ampullae marks the posterior edge of the equatorial region. The short ciliary nerves may sometimes be difficult to visualize. The short ciliary nerves vary in location; they are commonly located at the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions, but they may also be oriented radially.

      "answers": [" The photoreceptors   "],
      "explanation": "Electroretinograms (ERGs) are created by electric currents across the eye (the cornea is positive relative to the retinal pigment epithelium). ERGs are formed via the summation of the different electrical responses of the retina to various stimuli. In other words, when the retina is stimulated, specific cells become excited forming the electrical wave that creates the ERG. The A-wave of the ERG is formed by the photoreceptors. The B-wave occurs due to the responses from bipolar and Mueller cells. The C-wave is created by responses from retinal pigment epithelial cells, and the D-wave is attributable to activity of the OFF bipolar cells. The C-wave and the D-wave are not used clinically very often because they are susceptible to being obscured by blinking of the eye. It is also noteworthy that oscillations seen in the B-wave are due to responses of the amacrine cells."

      "answers": [" The cortex   "],
      "explanation": "The vitreal cortex is formed of condensed collagen fibrils, mucopolysaccharides and proteins which serves to envelop the vitreous body. The concentration of hyaluronic acid is approximately five to ten times greater than the inner vitreous. &#10;&#10;The primary vitreous develops at around the third week of gestation. It is formed by mesoderm. The secondary vitreous begins to develop during the ninth embryonic week. This later becomes the mature vitreous. The secondary vitreous stems from primary vitreal cells and retinal glial cells and therefore originates from neuroectoderm. The secondary vitreous expands to fill the globs while compacting the primary vitreous in the center of the globe. &#10;&#10;The hyaloid artery is a branch of the ophthalmic artery and is important for delivering nutrients to the lens and structures behind the lens during development. The artery disintegrates before birth leaving a canal in the primary vitreous called Cloquet's canal. Remnants of this artery are often perceived as 'floaters'."

      ],
      "answers": [" Thickening of an overlying retinal arteriole compressing the vein, resulting in a focal venous occlusion   "],
      "explanation": "Retinal venous occlusive diseases (such as branch retinal vein occlusions and central retinal vein occlusions) have an important association with arteriosclerotic disease. Retinal arterioles and their corresponding retinal veins share a common adventitial sheath at arteriovenous crossings. It is because of this characteristic that when a retinal artery becomes hardened and thickened as a result of arteriosclerosis, significant compression on the adjacent retinal vein can occur. Progressive and prolonged venous compression also causes changes in the retinal veins, which includes loss of venous endothelial cells and thrombus formation. Eventually, the artery will compress the vein enough that this, in conjunction with the other associated microvascular changes, will result in occlusion of the retinal vein leading to a central, or more commonly, branch retinal vein occlusion. &#10;&#10;Elevated intraocular pressure can also cause a venous occlusion; however, this most commonly results as a central retinal vein occlusion wherein the site of occlusion involves the edge of the optic cup."

The classic signs of retinopathy in these cases involves a 'bulls-eye' macular lesion that presents as a central island of pigment, surrounded by a hypopigmented zone of RPE atrophy that is also encircled by another area of hyperpigmentation. &#10;&#10;Chlorpromazine and thioridazine belong to the phenothiazines class of medication and also may cause retinal toxicity in high daily dosages. Retinopathy is typically characterized by pigmentary granularity and clumping in the mid-periphery and posterior pole. In addition to pigmentary changes, chlorpromazine may also cause focal or diffuse atrophy of the RPE and choriocapillaris."

      "answers": [" Tight junctions between the retinal pigment epithelial cells   "],
      "explanation": "The blood ocular barrier, specifically the blood retinal barrier, is the result of tight junctions at the base of retinal pigment epithelial cells and non-fenestrated capillaries. Normally, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ions, and glucose are free to enter the retina while the tight junctions prevent the passage of proteins from any leaky choroidal vessels. &#10;&#10;Circulating drugs and hormones are capable of affecting the choroid as these vessels are more permeable than retinal vessels. The retina is mostly impervious to the effects of systemic drugs and hormones due to the blood-retinal barrier created by the RPE. Circulating drugs that affect blood pressure are capable of altering retinal blood flow."

      "question": "On binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy of your 43 year-old patient, you see what appears to be a small U-shaped retinal tear in the far periphery at the 12 o'clock position of the left eye. You decide to use your 3-mirror Goldmann lens to obtain another view of the retina. Which 2 of the following modifications can be made in order to allow for the furthest possible peripheral view? (Select 2)",

      "answers": [" Tilt the Goldmann lens down   ", " Have the patient look up   "],
      "explanation": "There are some cases where a more peripheral view of the retina is desired than that which can be achieved with the patient in primary gaze and the Goldmann lens held in the upright position. In these situations, certain modifications can be made such as tilting the Goldmann lens or having the patient move their eyes. The lens should be tilted in the opposite direction of the location of the lesion, and the patient should be instructed to look in the actual direction of the area being viewed. &#10;&#10;For example, in the above question, the suspected lesion is at the 12 o'clock position. To obtain a more peripheral view, the lens should be tilted down, and the patient should be asked to look up."

      "explanation": "These plaques represent embolic phenomena referred to as Hollenhorst plaques. They are associated with atherosclerosis and a risk of stroke, possibly making all four tests appropriate. An MRI of the brain seeking other embolic activity, a treadmill to rule out coronary artery disease, and an EKG to establish a baseline are all reasonable, but the urgently needed test is a carotid ultrasound. The majority of Hollenhorst plaques comes from the carotid arteries and implies a risk of stroke in the near-term. This makes the rapid identification and institution of anti-platelet therapy with a referral to a vascular surgeon for a possible carotid an urgent referral. Hollenhorst plaque is a strong risk factor for stroke and is associated with atherosclerosis throughout the body but most particularly in the carotid artery. Therefore, a carotid Doppler ultrasound is the most important test to order."

      "explanation": "CSR is more commonly seen in middle-aged males under high-stress, who are very anxious, or with type A personalities. This condition causes fluid to leak from the choriocapillaries into the subretinal area, causing a serous detachment of the neurosensory retina. There is an associated loss of the foveal reflex, a hyperopic shift, a potential relative scotoma, and metamorphopsia. Flourescein angiography will reveal hyperfluorescence that appears like a smoke-stack. Evaluation of the posterior pole will typically display a blister-like elevation of the neurosensory retina. The patient is monitored monthly and intervention is rarely required, as most cases of CSR will resolve within roughly 6 months."

The treatment includes fish oil (or a prescription form, Lovaza), fenofibrate (common brand names include Trilipix and Tricor) and formally Gemfibrozil. Lipemia retinalis indicates that the triglyceride level is probably greater than 1000, indicating a possibility of the development of pancreatitis, so treatment is unequivocally indicated. The best treatment approach for modestly elevated triglycerides is diet, weight loss, alcohol avoidance, and restriction of simple carbohydrates such as wheat, flour, and sugar."

      "options": [" Vitreous base  ", " Optic nerve head  ", " Macula  ", " Retinal blood vessels   "],
      "answers": [" Retinal blood vessels   "],
      "explanation": "The vitreous body is normally attached posteriorly to several structures of the eye including the peripheral retinal blood vessels, macula, optic nerve head, and the vitreous base (which straddles the ora serrata). As the vitreous degenerates with age, a posterior vitreous detachment is a common observation that occurs as a result of the separation of the posterior hyaloid membrane from the internal limiting membrane of the retina; this can occur at any point posterior to the vitreous base. The most common location of a posterior vitreous detachment is at the site of vitreopapillary separation. &#10;&#10;The strongest area of attachment of the vitreous is at the ora serrata (vitreous base), followed by the optic nerve head. The adhesion in the area of the fovea is fairly weak, while the weakest attachment site of the vitreous body is along the peripheral retinal blood vessels."

      "answers": [" The perception of a floater   "],
      "explanation": "Syneresis and liquification of the vitreous are part of the normal aging process, but they also may cause a posterior vitreal detachment (PVD). Generally, PVDs occur without complication except for the perception of an annoying floater by the patient which will regress somewhat with time. Rarely, a PVD can cause a retinal tear which may lead to a retinal detachment, epiretinal membranes, and vitreal and retinal hemorrhages. Monitor the patient carefully to ensure that none of these complications develop and be sure to educate patients regarding the signs and symptoms of a retinal detachment."

      "answers": [" Vitreous syneresis   "],
      "explanation": "Vitreous syneresis occurs with advancing age, with a higher incidence noted in myopes and diabetics. Syneresis is caused by a separation of the fluid and solid components of the vitreous, resulting in the gel-like matrix of the vitreous becoming more liquefied. This liquification can lead to a posterior vitreous detachment. &#10;&#10;Asteroid hyalosis is generally a unilateral condition that presents as hundreds of small white calcium soap deposits suspended in the vitreous. The calcium soaps are attached to the collagen in the vitreous; hence, they do not fall to the bottom of the globe. Surprisingly, these deposits rarely affect visual acuity. &#10;&#10;A vitrectomy is surgical removal of the vitreous from the eye; this procedure is generally undertaken secondary to a large vitreal hemorrhage or in the event of a retinal detachment. &#10;&#10;Synchysis scintillans is generally a bilateral condition in which cholesterol crystals are found in the vitreous. The crystals are not attached and therefore tend to sink to the bottom of the globe due to gravitational forces. These crystals have not been linked to any systemic condition."

      "answers": [" Weiss ring   "],
      "explanation": "A Weiss ring is a solitary vitreal floater that typically has an annular shape, which represents the detachment of the vitreous from the margin of the optic disc. Patients will commonly report observing a large floater that is typically located slightly off to the temporal portion of their vision (due to the location of the optic nerve with respect to the macula). A Weiss ring is the most common finding associated with an acute posterior vitreous detachment. &#10;&#10;Bergmeister's papilla is a small tuft of fibrovascular tissue attached to the optic nerve, representing a remnant of the hyaloid artery. The anterior segment remnant of the hyaloid artery, which is apparent on the posterior surface of the crystalline lens in some patients, is known as a Mittendorf dot. Cloquet's canal is the small transparent canal that runs through the vitreous connecting the lens to the optic nerve, which once contained the hyaloid artery during fetal development."

The point at which the patient can correctly identify the pattern, and nothing further, represents the patient's contrast threshold (i.e., the patient will not be able to identify targets of any lower contrast). The patient's contrast sensitivity can then be calculated by simply taking the reciprocal of that fraction. For this question, the patient's contrast threshold is 1 percent, or 1/100. The reciprocal of this fraction is 100; therefore, her contrast sensitivity is determined to be 100. In some studies, a measurement of contrast sensitivity is preferably described in logarithmic terms. In this case, the above patient's contrast sensitivity would be 2 (log100 = 2)."

Vernier acuity is also known as hyperacuity due to the fact that it is approximately an order of magnitude better than standard resolution or letter acuity. In fact, this degree of acuity is well beyond the basic optical diffraction limit of the eye; therefore, we know that brain processing plays an integral role in this type of acuity. On average, most normal-sighted people can distinguish a discrepancy in the alignment of dots or lines as small as about 3-5 seconds of arc, or sometime even less, while standard acuity testing with letters has a threshold of about 1 minute of arc. &#10;&#10;Diagnosis and Management of Ocular Motility Disorders.

This concept is also known as the Nyquist Sampling Limit, which states that spatial frequencies can only be detected when they are less than one half of the sampling frequency. Therefore, the human visual system cannot detect sampling frequencies greater than 60 cycles per degree (cpd), because the cones of the fovea provide a sampling rate of about 120 cpd."

      "explanation": "Although one would initially believe that 100% of the available rhodopsin must be bleached in order for rods to become saturated, the true value is only 10%. That is, once 10% of the available rhodopsin becomes bleached, the rods are said to be saturated and can no longer respond to a change in stimuli. The reason for this lack of response is that this level of bleached pigment is attributable to the outer segment rod sodium channels. Exposure of rods to light causes closure of sodium channels leading to hyperpolarization. When approximately 10% of rhodopsin has become bleached, a certain number of sodium channels are closed and the rod is hyperpolarized to its fullest extent; further closure of sodium channels will no longer change the level of hyperpolarization."

      "question": "One section of the scotopic portion of a light adaptation curve is depicted as a line with a corresponding slope of infinity. This slope signifies that the rods of the visual system are saturated. What percentage of rhodopsin molecules is bleached in order for rod saturation to occur?",
      "options": [" 100%  ", " 30%  ", " 10%   ", " 50%  ", " 80%  "],
      "answers": [" 10%   "],
      "explanation": "A light adaptation curve is generated by conducting an increment threshold procedure. An increment threshold procedure is carried out by presenting a test spot (stimulus) against a background of a given luminance. The luminance of the stimulus is increased until detected by the observer, allowing for threshold determination. Once a threshold is ascertained, the brightness of the background is increased and the threshold for the increment is again established. The scotopic portion of the light adaptation curve can be broken into four sections. The final division of the scotopic section is a straight vertical line, which has a slope of infinity, thereby signifying rod saturation. Rod saturation occurs when 10% of the rhodopsin molecules have become bleached. At this point, a key number of sodium channels are closed, rendering the rod cell incapable of further signaling any information regarding the stimulus."

      "answers": [" 1 quanta of light   "],
      "explanation": "Rhodopsin is the biological molecule present in the photoreceptors of the retina that has the ability to absorb visible light and transduce that event into an electrical nerve impulse. Only one quanta (the smallest amount of light possible) of visible light is required in order to trigger a rhodopsin molecule, changing the molecule into a new shape that initiates the reaction. Not only is this molecule's sensitivity amazing, the stability of the molecule is also very impressive in that a rhodopsin molecule will never trigger accidentally."

      "answers": [" 4 cycles/degree   "],
      "explanation": "The human contrast sensitivity function allows researchers to determine over what range of contrasts humans can detect various sine wave gratings. Essentially, a subject views a sine wave grating on a computer screen that is below threshold so that the screen appears blank. The contrast of the grating is increased until the subject reports that he or she is able to perceive it. This is repeated again with sine waves of various spatial frequencies. The threshold contrasts are plotted as a function of spatial frequency, resulting in the contrast sensitivity function. This graph demonstrates that humans are capable of detecting a grating of 4 cycles per degree at a much lower contrast than any other spatial frequency."

      "answers": [" 507 nm   "],
      "explanation": "The absorption spectrum curve for rhodopsin shows peak absorption for wavelengths that are roughly 507 nm. This is determined by taking a sample of rhodopsin and projecting a fixed quantity of monochromatic light onto it and measuring the amount of light that is transmitted. Light that is not transmitted is absorbed; therefore the absorption curve and the transmitted curve are reciprocals of each other. The procedure is repeated with many different wavelengths. The wavelength that results in the greatest amount of absorption (or the least amount of transmitted light) is obviously the one that has the highest probability of absorption by rhodopsin. 555 nm is the peak sensitivity for photopic conditions."

Therefore, one would expect that a newborn would display poor color vision. Within the first few months of birth, the cone photoreceptors mature to the point where color vision and color discrimination are possible. Studies done on infants have revealed that color discrimination typically begins to appear at about 3-4 months of age. Additionally, it has also been found that infants categorize colors the same way that adult trichromats do. &#10;&#10;Visual Development, Diagnosis, and Treatment of the Pediatric Patient.

The scotopic system cannot discern colors and is very sensitive to dim illumination; the scotopic system also possesses poor spatial resolution, good spatial summation, good temporal summation, poor temporal resolution, and poor contrast sensitivity. The photopic system, on the other hand, possesses three photopigments - erythrolabe, cyanolabe, and chlorolabe. This system has phenomenal color discrimination as well as spatial and temporal resolution. Cones display poor temporal and spatial summation. The photopic system displays a peak spectral sensitivity to wavelengths that are 555 nm."

      "answers": [" A deuteranope   "],
      "explanation": "There are several classifications of color-vision defects; hereditary defects are the most common. The two broad categories are dichromacy and anomalous trichromacy. In dichromacy, one of the photopigments is missing; the type of dichromacy is categorized based on which photopigment is lacking. A deuteranope is missing chlorolabe, a tritanope is missing cyanolabe, and a protanope is missing erythrolabe. It is theorized that the missing photopigment is replaced by the photopigments that are present; otherwise, the person would likely suffer a deficit in visual acuity. Anomalous trichromats are in possession of all three photopigments but the absorption spectrum of one of the pigments has been shifted. For a protanomalous trichromat, the spectrum for erythrolabe is shifted towards the shorter wavelengths. A deuteranomalous trichromat displays a shift of the maximum sensitivity of chlorolabe towards the longer wavelengths. Protans and deutans are said to be red-green colorblind while tritans tend to mix up blues and yellows and are said to possess a blue-yellow defect; this is usually acquired rather than hereditary.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Color Vision Anomalies"

      "answers": [" The principal of univariance   "],
      "explanation": "The principal of univariance is derived from the fact that once quanta are absorbed by rhodopsin, all of the information pertaining to the light, such as wavelength, is lost. Therefore, if the photopigment rhodopsin is bleached, the wavelength does not matter because the final result will be equivalent. &#10;&#10;The Purkinje shift describes the shift in peak spectral sensitivities during the change from scotopic to photopic vision. Ultimately, this means that as lighting increases, longer wavelengths appear brighter because the peak spectral sensitivity for scotopic conditions is 507 nm and 555 nm for photopic vision. &#10;&#10;Mesopic conditions are those in which both rods and cones function simultaneously, such as during twilight. &#10;&#10;The retina is sometimes referred to as being duplex due to the fact that it possesses two separate groups of photoreceptors which function under different lighting conditions."

UV filters serve to absorb high-energy (short wavelength) UV light while allowing for the transmission of longer visible wavelengths. &#10;&#10;Interference filters possess a very small half-height bandwidth (the range of the spectrum over which the filter has a peak transmission of 50% or more). Because these filters block the majority of all wavelengths, they can essentially be considered monochromatic. &#10;&#10;Broad-band filters transmit wavelengths within a certain selected range.

Green-tinted lenses are useful for patients who are exposed to large amounts of reflected light. Yellow-tinted lenses block a good amount of UV light as well as blue and violet wavelengths. Yellow-tinted lenses are useful in diminished lighting cirumstances because these lenses enhance contrast. Hunters and sharpshooters frequently use amber lenses to enhance contrast, but these colored lenses also result in decreased color discrimination of certain wavelengths."

      "answers": [" A dichromat   "],
      "explanation": "Essentially an X-Chrome contact lens is a red contact lens that acts as a long-pass filter that blocks short wavelengths and allows longer wavelengths to pass through. Patients with abnormal color vision such as dichromats can benefit from this lens in that it aids in color distinction. Wearing the contact lens in one eye effectively shifts the color absorption curve of that eye so that it is different from the other eye; thus allowing the confusion lines of the patient to be altered between the eyes. In order for the lens to work properly, it is essential that the patient be able to easily alternate vision between the eyes for comparison. One of the drawbacks of the lens is that many patients will suppress the eye with the red lens or fuse the images, thereby reducing its effectiveness."

      "explanation": "The striate cortex is organized into discrete rows and columns that help to code for specifics of the stimulus. A hypercolumn consists of both a right and left eye ocular dominance column as well as orientation columns for every orientation. An electrode that penetrates the cortex perpendicularly will encounter cells with the same ocular dominance, and they all respond to stimuli of the same orientation. However, an electrode that penetrates the cortex parallel to its surface will encounter neurons that all possess the same ocular dominance but respond preferentially to stimuli of different orientations. In order for ocular dominance columns to form properly, it is essential that normal vision is present in both eyes during the early years of life."

      "options": [" Backward masking  ", " Forward masking   ", " Simultaneous masking  ", " Metacontrast  "],
      "answers": [" Forward masking   "],
      "explanation": "Masking involves the presentation of two stimuli to the visual system, one being the mask and the other being the target, to help gather information regarding how the visual system processes spatial and temporal information. The mask is supposed to interfere with the visibility of the target. Forward masking describes the situation in which the mask is presented before the target. Backward masking is when the target is presented first followed by the mask (the mask being brighter). Simultaneous masking occurs when the mask and the target are presented at the same time. Metacontrast is considered to be a type of backward masking in which the target is presented first followed by the mask, but the two stimuli are spatially adjacent. For example, an x is presented followed quickly by an O that is larger and surrounds the x but does not occupy the same space. Remember, the name of the masking type describes the location of the mask. Therefore, in forward masking the mask is presented before the target, and in backward masking the target precedes the mask, etc."

      "explanation": "Due to the fact that the eye does not respond to low temporal frequencies, stabilized retinal images are unable to be detected. Blood vessels that lie on top of the photoreceptors are considered stable relative to the retina. However, if you shine a penlight against your eyelid and move it rapidly, you will be able to see the shadows cast by the blood vessels on your retina. This is called a Purkinje tree. The penlight must be moving to ensure that the temporal frequency is great enough to be visualized."

      "options": [" Binocular rivalry  ", " Akinetopsia  ", " Stereopsis  ", " Motion parallax  "],
      "answers": [" Binocular rivalry  "],
      "explanation": "Binocular rivalry, as the name implies, occurs when two non-identical stimuli are displayed monocularly to corresponding retinal points but the images are not fusible. The observer's perception alternates between the two eyes/images; however, the alternation may be but is not necessarily equal between the eyes. &#10;&#10;Motion parallax refers to motion of two or more objects relative to an observer who is also moving. A way to remember this phenomenon is to imagine riding in a car while looking out the window. The objects that are closest to you will move faster and further across your visual field; those that are further away will move more slowly or appear to be stationary. &#10;&#10;Akinetopsia refers to a rare event in which a person cannot see movement in their visual field; this likely arises from a lesion to the middle temporal cortex (MT), which is important in the processing of motion. &#10;&#10;Stereopsis is a product of binocular retinal disparity. Stereopsis as a cue to depth works best if the objects are not too far away. In order for stereopsis to occur, the retinal disparity must be within a certain limit to result in a perception of depth."

      "explanation": "Dr. Kollner, an ophthalmologist, reviewed an extensive amount of literature on the nature of color vision impairment in patients with acquired ocular diseases. He concluded that most patients with diseases of the optic nerve tended to have difficultly discriminating red from green hues, while most patients with retinal disease (primarily macular) possessed a greater loss of discrimination between blue and yellow hues. This general dichotomy of red/green defects in optic nerve disease, and blue/yellow defects in macular disease has since come to be known as Kollner's rule. It is important to note that not all cases of acquired color vision deficiencies conform to this rule, however this theory holds true for the majority of patients."

      "answers": [" Interference filters   "],
      "explanation": "Interference filters possess a very small half-height bandwidth (the range of the spectrum over which the filter has a peak transmission of 50% or more). Because these filters block the majority of all wavelengths, they may be, in essence, deemed monochromatic. &#10;&#10;Long-pass filters absorb short wavelengths while allowing for the passage of longer wavelengths. Broad-band filters transmit wavelengths within a certain selected range. Narrow-band filters, like broad-band filters, allow for the transmission of wavelengths within a certain range; however, the extent of the narrow-band filter range is much more limited than a broad-band filter."

        " Central retinal distribution, color coding capabilities, and spatial sensitivities to high frequencies   ",

      ],
      "answers": [" Central retinal distribution, color coding capabilities, and spatial sensitivities to high frequencies   "],
      "explanation": "Parvo neurons are found in layers 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). These neurons tend to be smaller in caliber and display color opponency, central retinal distribution, respond to high spatial frequencies, and display a sustained response when shown a long-duration stimulus; therefore, parvo cells respond preferentially to low temporal frequencies. Parvo cells also transmit action potentials more slowly than magno cells due to their decreased diameter. &#10;&#10;Magno cells are located in layers 1 and 2 of the dLGN. These neurons are larger in diameter and possess very little if any color opponency, are located more peripherally in the retina, prefer low spatial frequencies, and display a short and transient response at the outset and the end of a stimulus presentation, regardless of the stimulus duration. Magno cells respond well to high temporal frequencies and transmit action potentials at higher speeds than parvo cells."

      "answers": [" Complex cells   "],
      "explanation": "The receptive fields of rod cells, ganglion cells and amacrine cells do not possess any preference for stimulus direction. They do respond differently to various brightness intensities and spot sizes. The receptive fields of simple cells respond preferentially to dark and light edges or bars that are of a specific orientation and thus have receptive fields that are split into antagonistic inhibitory and excitatory areas. &#10;&#10;Complex cells, like simple cells, prefer elongated stimuli of specific orientation; however, unlike simple cells, placement of the stimulus within a specific area of the receptive field is not critical. The stimulus can be placed anywhere within the receptive field of a complex cell and will elicit a response from the cell. Complex cells do, however, display a preference for direction. A stimulus moving in a certain direction will manifest a cellular response, whereas the same stimulus, if moved in the opposite direction, will not elicit a response. Also, the receptive fields of complex cells do not possess inhibitory and excitatory regions."

      "options": [" Cone photoreceptor regression  ", " Occipital lobe synergism  ", " Corneal epithelial cell interference  ", " Lateral inhibition of retinal cells   "],
      "answers": [" Lateral inhibition of retinal cells   "],
      "explanation": "The human contrast sensitivity function (CSF) allows researchers to determine over what range of contrasts humans can detect various sine wave gratings. Essentially, a subject views a sine wave grating on a computer screen that is below threshold so that the screen appears blank. The contrast of the grating is increased until the subject reports that he/she is able to perceive it. This is repeated again with sine waves of various spatial frequencies. The threshold contrasts are plotted as a function of spatial frequency, resulting in the contrast sensitivity function. This graph demonstrates that humans are capable of detecting a grating of 4 cycles per degree at a much lower contrast than any other spatial frequency. &#10;&#10;The CSF demonstrates a low-frequency drop-off which due to lateral inhibition of retinal cells. Lateral inhibition is best described in terms of the receptive field of a ganglion cell. The center of the receptive field is stimulated by light while the surround is inhibited by it. Therefore this type of cell would best respond to a grating whose spatial frequency would result in a light band aligning with the center and dark bands falling on the surround. With a spatial frequency that is too low (for example, 1 cycle per degree), the light band will fall upon both the center and the surround, resulting in a poor response from that cell. &#10;&#10;The CSF typically shows a cut-off of 60 cycles per degree even at 100% contrast for high spatial frequencies. There are several reasons for this cut-off. One of them is the system's inherent natural optical aberrations; another is the retinal distribution of photoreceptors. Photoreceptors that are more tightly packed are able to discern a greater amount of detail than those that are loosely packed. Think of alternating light and dark bands. In order to properly appreciate these bands, one bright band must fall on one photoreceptor and an adjacent dark band must stimulate an adjacent receptor. If the receptors are too big or loosely packed a light band may fall on half of one receptor and half of another; receptors then sum the information, causing a loss of visual information and the inability to properly discern the grating. The above is referred to as the Nyquist sampling theorem."

      "explanation": "Snellen acuity is an example of both recognition and resolution acuity. Recognition is the ability to recognize a target such as a letter or number. However in order for recognition to occur one must first be able to resolve the target. Resolution acuity is defined as the capacity to discern two or more targets that are spatially separated. The human threshold for resolution acuity is approximately 30 seconds of arc. &#10;&#10;Detection acuity is described as the ability to determine whether a target is present or absent in an empty field. The minimum threshold for humans is one second of arc. &#10;&#10;Vernier acuity is defined as the capacity to detect lateral misalignment of two objects that are separated by space.

The postulation has been put forth that selective suppression of the magno pathway maintains a clear retinal image during eye movements. In terms of function, this would make sense because the magno pathway is considered the 'where' pathway and responds to quickly-moving objects as well as high temporal frequencies, both of which occur to the background during a saccade."

      ],
      "answers": [" Due to the abundant presence of monocular cues to depth in our world   "],
      "explanation": "Although monovision purposely disrupts binocular clarity and sometimes fusion, most patients maintain a surprising amount of depth perception due to the fact that we are surrounded by monocular cues to depth. Several of these monocular cues fall under the category of pictorial depth cues; that is, cues that can be represented in a two-dimensional image such as a painting. The pictorial cues to depth are clarity, texture, interposition, linear perspective, size, shadow, and lighting. Other monocular depth cues include motion parallax and accommodation. Size can be further sub-divided into relative size and familiar size. Relative size, as its name infers, is the ability to discern depth based on the size of an object relative to another; for example, given two trees that are assumed to be the same size, a tree that stimulates less retinal space would be perceived as further away than one that subtends a larger retinal area. &#10;&#10;A good example of linear perspective is a drawing of a building. The bottom of the building is very wide and the space between the left and right contour lines is large, however to infer depth as one moves up the page, the left and right contour lines get closer together and appear to be farther away from the observer. &#10;&#10;Motion parallax refers to motion of two or more objects relative to an observer who is also moving. A good way to remember this is to imagine riding in a car and looking out the window. The objects that are closest to you will move faster and further across your visual field while those that are further away will move more slowly or appear to be stationary. &#10;&#10;Although a successful monovision candidate displays ocular dominance, without monocular depth cues one would not be able to attain good depth perception.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Monocular Cues to Depth"

      "question": "White light projected onto a prism will result in a spectrum of wavelengths resembling a rainbow. Which of the colors experiences the greatest amount of deviation from the apex of the prism?",
      "options": [" Green  ", " Violet   ", " Red  ", " Orange  ", " Yellow  "],
      "answers": [" Violet   "],
      "explanation": "Because white light is a blend of various wavelengths, it can be split apart into its individual wavelengths by projecting it onto a prism. Keep in mind that the degree of deviation is inversely proportional to the wavelength; therefore, longer wavelengths experience less deviation while shorter wavelengths will deviate to a greater degree. Out of the above choices, violet is the shortest wavelength and therefore will be bent to the greatest extent towards the base of the prism. The wavelength for red light is roughly 650 nm, orange 600 nm, yellow 570 nm, green 520 nm, blue 470 nm and violet 400 nm."

      "question": "Which of the following BEST describes a hereditary color vision defect?",
      "options": [" High propensity to worsen with time  ", " Tends to be asymmetrical between the eyes  ", " It is typically blue-yellow in nature  ", " More prevalent in males   "],
      "answers": [" More prevalent in males   "],
      "explanation": "Red-green color defects are much more frequent than blue-yellow color defects. Red-green defects also tend to be hereditary, while blue-yellow defects are more likely to be acquired. Color defects that are hereditary are found predominantly in males and are stable with time, equal between the eyes, and are relatively easily categorized via regular clinical color vision tests. In contrast, acquired color defects are more likely to be asymmetrical between the eyes, may change or worsen with time, and are found in equal ratio between women and men, occurring secondary to some type of pathology."

      "answers": [" High sensitivity to dim illumination, poor spatial resolution, increased spatial summation, increased temporal summation   "],
      "explanation": "The scotopic system contains rhodopsin as its photopigment whose peak absorbency is 507 nm. The scotopic system cannot discern colors and is very sensitive to dim illumination, possesses poor spatial resolution, good spatial summation, good temporal summation, poor temporal resolution, and poor contrast sensitivity. The photopic system, on the other hand, possesses three photopigments-- erythrolabe, cyanolabe, and chlorolabe. This system has phenomenal color discrimination as well as spatial and temporal resolution. Cones display poor temporal and spatial summation."

This type of person displays a low threshold and high sensitivity (remember that threshold and sensitivity are reciprocals of each other). On the other hand, an observer who maintains a strict threshold will have a high threshold and low sensitivity. This person will not respond to seeing a stimulus unless they are absolutely certain that they see it."

      "explanation": "Visual acuity remains unchanged for a moving stimulus until its velocity reaches between 60 to 80 degrees per second. The ability to clearly track a moving target is termed dynamic visual acuity. Our limited visual acuity at high speeds is likely due to the fact that we are unable to move our eyes quickly enough to follow the stimulus."

      "answers": [" It decreases   "],
      "explanation": "Bloch's law applies to temporal summation and therefore to stimuli that are separated by time. According to Bloch, as long as stimuli are presented within a critical period (100 msec for the scotopic system and 10-50 msec for the photopic system), the total number of quanta necessary for threshold to be reached remains the same for different flash durations. Mathematically the relationship is expressed as: &#10;I(t)=K where I= stimulus intensity (quanta/time), t= stimulus duration, and K= constant. For this relationship to hold true, I and t are inversely proportional to each other. As the stimulus intensity increases, the flash duration must decrease."

      ],
      "answers": [" It will decrease the CSF of all spatial frequencies   "],
      "explanation": "As clinicians, we tend to test only high-spatial frequency functioning. However, in the above case, as well as with cataracts, patients may present complaining of blurry vision even though acuity may be measured to be 20/20 or 20/25. Both cataracts and corneal edema can diffuse or scatter light causing a decrease across all spatial frequencies. Therefore it is important not to dismiss the patient too quickly when they note decreased vision, even though they may possess 20/20 vision. In the above case, one should consider performing a visual acuity test with low contrast such as the Bailey-Lovie low contrast acuity chart or the Pelli-Robson test to assess for a deficit in contrast sensitivity."

These neurons tend to be larger in caliber and are generally called M-cells or magno cells. The four most outer layers of the dLGN make up the parvocellular layers. Cells of layers 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus have smaller neurons and are known as P-cells. The magno and parvo pathways constitute parallel processing streams because they both process different information about visual details. The parvo pathway streams information pertaining to color and detail whereas the magno pathway codes information regarding fast motion. Some researchers describe the parvo system as the 'what' system and the magno pathway as the 'where' system."

      "question": "The typical human contrast sensitivity function (CSF) for a young adult free of ocular pathology displays a high-spatial frequency cut-off of around 60 cycles per degree. What is the cause for this cut-off of high-frequency resolution?",
      "options": [" Limited cortical processing  ", " Increased lateralization between the hemispheres  ", " Loss of visual information due to cross-over at the optic chiasm  ", " Spacing of the photoreceptors   "],
      "answers": [" Spacing of the photoreceptors   "],
      "explanation": "The human contrast sensitivity function (CSF) allows researchers to determine over what range of contrasts humans can detect various sine wave gratings. Essentially, a subject views a sine wave grating on a computer screen that is below threshold so that the screen appears blank. The contrast of the grating is increased until the subject reports that he/she is able to perceive it. This is repeated again with sine waves of various spatial frequencies. The threshold contrasts are plotted as a function of spatial frequency, resulting in the contrast sensitivity function. This graph demonstrates that humans are capable of detecting a grating of 4 cycles per degree at a much lower contrast than any other spatial frequency. The CSF typically shows a cut-off of 60 cycles per degree even at 100% contrast for high spatial frequencies. There are several reasons for this cut-off. One of them is the system's inherent natural optical aberrations. Another is the retinal distribution of photoreceptors. Photoreceptors that are more tightly packed are able to discern a greater amount of detail than those that are loosely packed. Think of alternating light and dark bands. In order to properly appreciate these bands, one bright band must fall on one photoreceptor and an adjacent dark band must stimulate an adjacent receptor. If the receptors are too big or loosely packed, a light band may fall on half of one receptor and half of another; receptors then sum the information, causing a loss of visual information and the inability to properly discern the grating. The above is referred to as the Nyquist sampling theorem."

      "question": "Which of the following is considered a binocular cue to depth?",
      "options": [" Linear perspective  ", " Stereopsis   ", " Motion parallax  ", " Relative size  "],
      "answers": [" Stereopsis   "],
      "explanation": "There are several pictorial depth cues, that is, cues that can be represented in a two-dimensional image such as a painting. The pictorial cues to depth are clarity (also known as aerial perspective), texture, interposition, linear perspective, size, shadow, and lighting. Other monocular depth cues include motion parallax and accommodation. Size can be further sub-divided into relative size and familiar size. Relative size, as its name infers, is the ability to discern depth based upon the size of an object relative to another. For example, given two trees that are assumed to be the same size, the tree that stimulates less retinal space would be perceived as further away than one that subtends a larger retinal area. &#10;&#10;A good example of linear perspective is a drawing of a building. The bottom of the building is very wide and the space between the left and right contour lines is large; however, to infer depth as one moves up the page, the left and right contour lines get closer together and appear to be farther away from the observer. &#10;&#10;Motion parallax refers to motion of two or more objects relative to an observer who is also in motion. A good way to remember this is to think of riding in a car and looking out the window. The objects that are closest to you will move faster and further across your visual field, while those that are further away will move more slowly or appear to be stationary. &#10;&#10;Binocular cues to depth are stereopsis and convergence. Stereopsis is a product of binocular retinal disparity. Stereopsis as a cue to depth works best if the objects are not too far away. In order for stereopsis to occur, the retinal disparity must be within a certain limit to result in a perception of depth."

      "answers": [" Frequency, phase, orientation, and contrast   "],
      "explanation": "Sine wave gratings are specified by frequency, phase, orientation and contrast. Frequency denotes the number of cycles of alternating dark and light bands per degree. Contrast describes the luminance profile of the grating; this is basically the difference in luminance between the light and the dark bands. Mathematically, this can be calculated as contrast= the difference in luminance between the peak and trough/the total luminance of the peak and the trough. The phase of the sine wave grating is relative to another grating. Two gratings are in phase if their positions are the same (i.e., their peaks and troughs align) or 180 degrees out of phase (i.e., the trough of one grating is aligned with the peak of the other). The orientation refers to the angle of the grating in reference to horizontal or vertical."

This concept is important, especially for experimental purposes where it is important for all of the subjects to experience the same amount of retinal illumination irrespective of pupil size. &#10;&#10;Lux units are used for illuminance, and lumens are the unit for measuring luminous power.

Luminous intensity is described as the light power that is generated by a point source in any given direction and is measured in candelas. Luminance is essentially the brightness of a surface and is measured in foot-lamberts or candelas per square meter. Luminance does not change with viewing distance. Illuminance is a measure of the amount of light that falls onto a surface and is measured in lumens/square meter or lumens/square foot. Luminance measures the amount of light reflected off of a surface while illuminance describes how much light falls onto a surface."

      "options": [" Mach bands  ", " The phi phenomenon   ", " The Troxler effect  ", " After-images  "],
      "answers": [" The phi phenomenon   "],
      "explanation": "Within our visual world there are many examples of apparent motion in which the observer perceives motion that physically does not occur. Consider a lighted sign such as in the above question. The advertising makes use of the phi phenomenon or stroboscopic motion to create illusory motion. By flashing lights in sequence within a certain timed interval (60-200 milliseconds apart) one can create the illusion that the light is moving when really it is just one light being turned off while the light adjacent to it is flashed on and so forth. &#10;&#10;Troxler's effect occurs when the eye is fixated (although the eye is truly always moving) on a point in space and the surrounding background begins to blend together. There must be several factors that come into play in order for the Troxler effect to transpire. The best example of the Troxler effect is the figure in which there are two squares that are superimposed. The smaller square is centered in the larger square and is slightly lighter than the larger surrounding square. The border between the squares is blurred, resulting in a distinction of the two squares based upon brightness alone. When fixating upon an X placed in the center of the smaller square, the border completely disappears as does the smaller square, resulting in the perception of one uniformly-colored large square. &#10;&#10;Mach bands are typically observed when there is a smooth transition between white/gray to black. Bands are perceived within the transition zones. These bands are created by the visual system due to the augmentation of high spatial frequencies. This augmentation results in the perception of bands at transition zones."

      "question": "Color vision deficits and their respective confusion lines can be plotted on a CIE curve. What is the locus of origin for all of the confusion lines for a deuteranope called?",
      "options": [" Neutral points  ", " The copunctal point   ", " The Planckian locus  ", " Complementary colors  "],
      "answers": [" The copunctal point   "],
      "explanation": "There are several classifications of color-vision defects; hereditary defects are the most common. The two broad categories are dichromacy and anomalous trichromacy. In dichromacy, one of the photopigments is missing; the type of dichromacy is categorized based on the photopigment that is lacking. A deuteranope is missing chlorolabe, a tritanope is missing cyanolabe, and a protanope is missing erythrolabe. It is theorized that the missing photopigment is replaced by the photopigments that are present; otherwise, the person would likely suffer a deficit in visual acuity. Anomalous trichromats are in possession of all three photopigments, but the absorption spectrum of one of the pigments has been shifted. For a protanomalous trichromat, the spectrum for erythrolabe is shifted towards the shorter wavelengths. A deuteranomalous trichromat displays a shift of the maximum sensitivity of chlorolabe towards the longer wavelengths. Protans and deutans are said to be red-green colorblind while tritans tend to mix up blues and yellows and are said to possess a blue-yellow defect; this defect is usually acquired rather than hereditary. &#10;&#10;Dichromats possess different confusion lines depending on which photopigment they are lacking. All of the colors that reside upon a confusion line are indistinguishable from each other. All of the respective confusion lines for each type of dichromat originate from a position called the copunctal point. The copunctal points for each dichromat reside at different locations on the CIE diagram, allowing for easy distinction between the different types of dichromat. &#10;&#10;Neutral points on the CIE diagram are those wavelengths that intersect with the copunctal point, the white point (W) and the chromaticity diagram and will be perceived as white (think of a line originating at the copunctal point passing through W and the curve; this point on the curve is the wavelength that will appear white). Neutral points vary for each dichromat. &#10;&#10;The CIE can be used to determine the dominant wavelength and the excitation purity of a mixture of two colors. Complementary colors are those that can be mixed together to produce the color white and can be calculated by drawing a line from one side of the CIE curve to the other ensuring to pass through the white locus. The complementary wavelength can then be read off of the diagram. The Planckian locus is a small arc within the diagram that contains variations of white created by blackbody radiators at various temperatures."

This process is repeated for every spectral wavelength, creating a tristimulus value for each wavelength. The only flaw was that negative values of the primaries occasionally needed to be used. The CIE system overcame this problem by introducing imaginary primaries and mathematically manipulating the numbers so that they could be easily plotted on a graph. The CIE diagram displays the quantities of each of the three imaginary primaries necessary to match a real color. With the CIE chromaticity diagram, given only two coordinates for a wavelength (or two of the three tristimulus values), it is possible to easily solve for the third. On the CIE diagram, the imaginary primaries are located outside of the diagram because they are not obtainable. The diagram resembles a horseshoe. The arc of the horseshoe contains the monochromatic hues and is called the spectral locus. The two ends of the horseshoe can be connected, and the nonspectral purples (which are not monochromatic) are located on this line. White is located in the center of the diagram. &#10;&#10;The CIE can be used to determine the dominant wavelength and the excitation purity of a mixture of two colors. Complementary colors are those that can be mixed together to produce the color white and can be calculated by drawing a line from one side of the CIE curve to the other, ensuring to pass through the white locus. The complementary wavelength can then be read off of the diagram. The Planckian locus is a small arc within the diagram that contains variations of white created by blackbody radiators at various temperatures. &#10;&#10;Source: Schwartz, Steven.

      "explanation": "Visual information is funneled to the optic nerve, where it travels to the optic chiasm; at that point, information from the nasal retina crosses over and joins with information from the temporal retina of the opposite eye. The visual input then moves down the optic tract to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and onto the striate cortex. The striate cortex (also known as visual area 1 (V1), the primary visual cortex or Brodmann area 17), is where cortical magnification of foveal input occurs because foveal vision is largely over-represented in V1. Some axons then project to the extrastriate cortex areas for higher processing."

      "answers": [" The Troxler effect   "],
      "explanation": "The Troxler effect occurs when the eye is fixated (although the eye is truly always moving) on a point in space and the surrounding background begins to blend together. There must be several factors that come into play in order for the Troxler effect to transpire. The best example of the Troxler effect is the figure in which there are two squares that are superimposed. The smaller square is centered in the larger square and is slightly lighter than the larger surrounding square. The border between the squares is blurred, resulting in a distinction of the two squares based upon brightness alone. When fixating upon an X placed in the center of the smaller square, the border completely disappears as does the smaller square, resulting in the perception of one uniformly-colored large square. Some patients experience the Troxler effect while performing a visual field via FDT. They report, especially during testing of the second eye, that the entire field appears to go gray. When this occurs, make sure to inform the patient to blink."

      ],
      "answers": [" Ask the patient what is the color of the perceived light  "],
      "explanation": "The red lens test can be performed at both distance and near. When evaluating a patient's second-degree fusion at near, a transilluminator is held at 40.0 cm and a red lens is placed over the preferred eye. The patient is directed to look at the transilluminator. The patient should be asked how many lights they perceive. If the patient answers that only one light is seen, then the clinician should ask the patient the color of the light source. The patient should report seeing a pinkish or red/white shimmering circle, which would represent a composite image of the two eyes. If a white light is seen, the patient is suppressing the eye behind the red lens. If the patient reports seeing a red circle, she is suppressing the eye without the red lens. If the patient reports seeing two lights, she should be asked where the red light is in relation to the white light (i.e., is the red light to the left or right of the white light?) to establish the presence of crossed or uncrossed diplopia."

      "answers": [" Entoptic phenomenon   "],
      "explanation": "Entoptic phenomena are visual perceptions that are caused by a source within the eye itself. In most cases, these phenomena occur under certain lighting conditions in which certain objects within the eye can become visible. Examples of entoptic phenomena include floaters, the blue field entoptic phenomena (white blood cells can be seen moving in capillaries), Haidinger's brush, and phosphenes. The Purkinje tree is another entoptic phenomenon in which an image of the retinal blood vessels can be observed by one's own eye (as in the above patient). &#10;&#10;Palinopsia is a type of visual disturbance that is characterized by the persistence of images in the vision, even after the stimulus is gone. These are also known as afterimages but are observed in a significantly greater degree in patients with palinopsia. &#10;&#10;Prosopagnosia is a visual disorder in which patients do not have the ability to adequately recognize faces while other areas of visual perception remain intact. &#10;&#10;Phosphenes are a subcategory of entoptic phenomenon in which a person will perceive light without light actually entering the eye. These light images are commonly observed when a person puts mechanical pressure on the globe but can also be seen in cases of optic neuritis or other stimulation of the retina or visual cortex. &#10;&#10;A scintillating scotoma is a common visual aura that occurs preceding the development of a migraine."

      "answers": [" High sensitivity and poor resolution   "],
      "explanation": "Spatial summation is utilized by the scotopic system and allows for greater sensitivity at the cost of resolution. Information from several rods across space is funneled indirectly onto one ganglion cell (rods do not directly synapse onto ganglion cells). Because the information is received from several rods, this combines to increase the chances of detecting an object (i.e., increased sensitivity). However, because the area over which the information is gathered is large and it is sent to one ganglion cell, the resolution is poor. This is in opposition to the photopic system, which displays a much smaller degree of spatial summation, leading to decreased sensitivity but greater resolution. For example, two lights that are flashed close together both in time and space will be coded as one flash by the scotopic system because the information is sent to one ganglion cell. However, the same stimuli will be perceived as two lights by the photopic system due to the stimulation of two adjacent ganglion cells, thereby enabling this system to code for two different stimuli, resulting in greater resolution."

In essence, a figure (usually a symbol, number or letter) must be discerned from a background, using color as a cue to help create contours. Patients who suffer from a color defect will be unable to see the figure. The one drawback to this test is that very few renditions of this test offer the ability to detect blue-yellow deficits. Therefore, because the above patient suffers from a color vision anomaly and he performed normally on color vision testing, it is likely that he suffers from a blue-yellow deficit. &#10;&#10;Primary Care Optometry 5th edition.

      "answers": [" Resolution acuity   "],
      "explanation": "Resolution acuity deals with the ability to discern a figure or pattern from a background. Snellen visual acuity is a type of resolution acuity. As optometrists, we provide the patient with the best possible resolution acuity through the use of optical aids and devices; therefore, this type of acuity is greatly affected by defocus. Vernier acuity is also known as hyperacuity. This type of acuity deals with differences in alignment and direction. Humans have excellent vernier acuity that is very minimally affected by defocus. Minimum detectable acuity is the ability of the visual system to detect the presence of an object. Consider a very fine wire against the background of a blue sky. Minimum detectable acuity begs the question, how thin can the wire be made before the visual system can no longer perceive it? This type of acuity is also affected by defocus to a very small extent."

      "question": "The change in peak spectral sensitivity from higher wavelengths to lower wavelengths as the surrounding illumination decreases is the basis for which of the following theories?",
      "options": [" Ricco's law  ", " The Purkinje shift   ", " Bloch's law  ", " Weber's law  "],
      "answers": [" The Purkinje shift   "],
      "explanation": "Purkinje observed that as illumination increases, we transition from viewing with the scotopic system to the photopic system, and the peak spectral sensitivity changes from shorter to longer wavelengths. Under dim illumination, we tend to rely on rods to maximize visual sensitivity. Scotopic vision is primarily mediated by rods; as a result, this leads to heightened sensitivity to low light conditions but at the cost of poor acuity (20/200) and little to no color vision. The scotopic system is most sensitive to detecting wavelengths that are 507 nm. Photopic vision, on the other hand, occurs in bright light and is characterized by phenomenal acuity (20/20), color discrimination, and is dominated by cones. The photopic system is most sensitive to wavelengths that are 555 nm. &#10;&#10;Ricco's law holds only for stimuli that are below a critical diameter. Mathematically, the relationship is expressed as, IA=K, with I= stimulus intensity (quanta/area), A= stimulus area, and K=constant. Therefore, according to Ricco's law, the threshold number of quanta necessary for stimulus detection is constant, with stimulus intensity and stimulus area having a reciprocal relationship. As the value of I increases, the value of A must decrease in order for K to remain the same. &#10;&#10;Weber's Law deals with the just noticeable difference and can be expressed mathematically as, K= delta I/I, where K= Weber's constant, delta I= that difference threshold, and I= the original stimulus intensity (weight, etc.). &#10;&#10;Bloch's law applies to temporal summation and therefore to stimuli that are separated by time. According to Bloch, as long as stimuli are presented within a critical period (100 msec for the scotopic system and 10-50 msec for the photopic system), the total number of quanta necessary for threshold to be reached remains the same for different flash durations. Mathematically, the relationship is expressed as, I(t)=K where I= stimulus intensity (quanta/time), t= stimulus duration, and K= constant. For this relationship to hold true, I and t are inversely proportional to each other. As the stimulus intensity increases, the flash duration must decrease."

      "options": [" Scalar properties  ", " Grassmann's law  ", " Metamers   ", " Dichromats  "],
      "answers": [" Metamers   "],
      "explanation": "Two stimuli that are physically different but appear to be the same are called metamers. A dichromat is a person who, if given three wavelengths of light that are divided into two separate patches, is able to adjust the intensities of the wavelengths so that the two patches appear the same. For example, on one side of the patch is wavelength A and on the other side are wavelengths B and C. A dichromat would be able to adjust the intensities of wavelengths B and C so that they appear to be identical; however, a trichromat would not. Grassmann's laws of metamers consists of the additivity property, the scalar property, and the associative property. The additive property states that if you add an equal amount of a new wavelength to each metamer, they will remain metamers. The scalar property of metamers states that if the intensities of the metamers are increased or decreased equally, they will remain metamers. Lastly, the law of associative property of metamers explains that if a metamer is substituted for another, the two metamers will still match. For example, wavelength A+B= wavelength C+D. However, wavelength A= wavelength K+J; therefore, wavelength K+J+B= wavelength C+D."

      "answers": [" Metamorphopsia   "],
      "explanation": "Metamorphopsia is a type of visual distortion in which perceived linear images appear wavy or broken. This commonly occurs in macular diseases such as macular degeneration, clinically significant macular edema, central serous retinopathy, etc. Clinicians typically test for this visual symptom using an Amsler Grid. &#10;&#10;Micropsia is a type of visual distortion in which images appear to be decreased in size; this is caused by the spreading apart of foveal cones. Contrastingly, macropsia is a perceived increase in image size as a result of a crowding together of foveal cones. Both of these visual symptoms are very uncommon. &#10;&#10;Photopsia is a perceived flash of light that is most commonly associated with traction of the retina in cases of a retinal break, tear, or detachment, or most commonly, a posterior vitreous detachment. &#10;&#10;Scotomas are areas of the visual field whereby vision is a partially or entirely degenerated."

      "explanation": "Photoreceptors inner and outer segments are thin cylinders that posses a higher index of refraction than the surrounding tissues; therefore, they act as optic fibers that exhibit total internal reflection when light is incident along the fiber's axis. Light that enters the photoreceptor from peripheral angles is more likely to escape into surrounding tissue and has a lesser chance of isomerizing a photopigment molecule than light that is incident in the same direction; this concept is known as the Stiles-Crawford effect. Experiments have shown that there is a large variance of sensitivity to light as it passes through different areas of the pupil. For most individuals, the center of the pupil and the orientation of the photoreceptor axes that provides the greatest sensitivity are not at the exact same location. The peak photoreceptor sensitivity location is actually about 0.2 to 0.5mm nasal to the center of the pupil."

      "answers": [" Bailey-Lovie   "],
      "explanation": "The Bailey-Lovie chart is a unique visual acuity chart that was designed on a logarithmic basis, with the visual acuity measurement designated on the basis of the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR). For example, visual acuity of 20/20 represents a minimum angle of resolution (MAR) of 1 minute of arc. The logarithm of 1 is 0. Therefore, 20/20 is equivalent to LogMAR 0.0. Another example we could use would be a visual acuity of 20/200. This represents a minimum angle of resolution (MAR) of 10 minutes of arc. The logarithm of 10 is 1. Therefore, 20/200 is equivalent to LogMAR 1.0. &#10;&#10;Additionally, there is a standard size progression ratio from line to line, each line has the same number of optotypes, and there is a constant spacing utilized between each row and each letter of the chart. This is the type of acuity chart that was used in the ETDRS protocol."

      "question": "Which of the following 3 items can be determined using the CIE chromaticity diagram? (Select 3)",
      "options": [
        " The amount of photopigment in a molecule of rhodopsin  ",
        " The regeneration time of a photopigment  ",
        " Complimentary colors  ",
        " The excitation purity of a stimulus  ",

      ],
      "answers": [" Complimentary colors  ", " The excitation purity of a stimulus  ", " The dominant wavelength of a stimulus  "],
      "explanation": "The CIE color specification system was designed to help create a standard system to designate colors. Its design is based upon the RGB system, which basically takes a bipartite field (a split field) and determines the degree to which the three primaries (red, green and blue) must be manipulated to match a wavelength displayed on the right side of the field. This process is repeated for every spectral wavelength, resulting in a tristimulus value for each wavelength. The only flaw was that negative values of the primaries occasionally needed to be used. The CIE system overcame this problem with the introduction of imaginary primaries and mathematical manipulation of the numbers so that they could be easily plotted on a graph. The CIE diagram displays the quantities of each of the three imaginary primaries necessary to match a real color. With the CIE chromaticity diagram, given only two coordinates for a wavelength (or two of the three tristimulus values), it is possible to solve for the third. On the CIE diagram, the imaginary primaries are located outside of the diagram because they are not obtainable. The diagram resembles a horseshoe. The arc of the horseshoe contains the monochromatic hues and is called the spectral locus. The two ends of the horseshoe can be connected, and the nonspectral purples (which are not monochromatic) are located on this line. White is located in the center of the diagram. &#10;&#10;The CIE can be used to determine the dominant wavelength and the excitation purity of a mixture of two colors. Complementary colors are those that can be mixed together to produce the color white and can be calculated by drawing a line from one side of the CIE curve to the other, making sure to pass through the white locus. The complementary wavelength can then be read off of the diagram. The Planckian locus is a small arc within the diagram that contains variations of white created by blackbody radiators at various temperatures. &#10;&#10;Reference: Schwartz, Steven.

      ],
      "answers": [" The rod portion of the curve will plateau at a higher than normal threshold for a person with retinitis pigmentosa   "],
      "explanation": "In order to generate a dark adaptation curve, an observer is exposed to a bright light that bleaches almost all of the photopigments. Once the light is turned off, the observer is left in a totally dark room and asked to detect large, centrally fixated, flashing stimuli allowing for depiction of the detection threshold as a function of time to be measured. The result is a dark adaptation curve. The initial portion of the curve displays a rapid decrease in threshold during the first five minutes, which correlates with the regeneration of cone pigments and cone thresholds. The curve then plateaus and is followed by another, more gradual decrease in threshold after about 10 minutes. This section of the curve is called the rod-cone break; at this point, the rods become more sensitive than the cones. The second dip is caused by regeneration of the rods, allowing detection of the stimulus. Cones take about 10 minutes to fully recover; rods have a total recovery time of 35 minutes (see image 1). &#10;&#10;A patient with early retinitis pigmentosa will exhibit a dark adaptation curve wherein the rod section of the curve shows that a prolonged regeneration time.

      "question": "A patient suffering from dichromacy lacks one of the three photopigments necessary for normal color vision but possesses 20/20 vision. What is the MOST likely reason that this patient is able to retain good visual acuity despite the fact that he is missing a photopigment?",
      "options": [
        " The cortical area associated with color vision is more complex in these individuals  ",
        " The missing photopigment is replaced by the remaining photopigments that are present   ",
        " The color processing pathway allocates more neurons to color vision in people with dichromacy  ",
        " Patients with dichromacy possess more cone receptors than patients with normal color vision  "
      ],
      "answers": [" The missing photopigment is replaced by the remaining photopigments that are present   "],
      "explanation": "In dichromacy, one of the photopigments is missing; the type of dichromacy is categorized based on which photopigment is lacking. A deuteranope is missing chlorolabe, a tritanope is missing cyanolabe, and a protanope is missing erythrolabe. It is theorized that the missing photopigment is replaced by the photopigments that are present; otherwise, the person would likely suffer a deficit in visual acuity. In the instance of a protanope, it is likely that erythrolabe is replaced with chlorolabe. Protanopes and deuteranopes confuse red and green. Tritanopes confuse blues and yellows. Deuteranopes possess a neutral point of 498 nm. Wavelengths above the neutral point are perceived as various saturated levels of yellow, and those below the neutral point are viewed as shades of blue that become more saturated as the wavelength decreases. Protanopes possess a neutral point of 492 nm. Wavelengths above the neutral point are perceived as various hues of yellow, and those below the neutral point are seen as blue. A tritanope has a neutral point of 570 nm. Wavelengths above 570 nm are seen as shades of red, and those below are observed as green. Wavelengths at the neutral point are seen as white."

      "question": "During the generation of a dark adaptation curve, the stimulus is changed from 420 nm to 650 nm. How will the resulting dark adaptation curve vary from the original?",

        " The curve will lack a rod-cone break   ",

        " The overall time period for dark adaptation will be considerably longer  "
      ],
      "answers": [" The curve will lack a rod-cone break   "],
      "explanation": "In order to generate a dark adaptation curve, an observer is exposed to a bright light that bleaches almost all of the photopigments. Once the light is turned off, the observer is left in a totally dark room and asked to detect large, centrally fixated, flashing stimuli, typically 420 nm, allowing for depiction of the detection threshold as a function of time to be measured. The result is a dark adaptation curve. The initial portion of the curve displays a rapid decrease in threshold during the first five minutes, which correlates with the regeneration of cone pigments and cone thresholds. The curve then plateaus and is followed by another, more gradual decrease in threshold after about 10 minutes. This section of the curve is called the rod-cone break; at this point the rods become more sensitive than the cones.

Cones take about 10 minutes to fully recover; rods have a total recovery time of 35 minutes. &#10;&#10;If the wavelength of the stimulus is changed to 650 nm, the rod portion of the curve essentially disappears and, therefore, a rod-cone break is lacking. With a stimulus of 650 nm, the dark adaptation curve consists of only the cone portion of the curve. The reason that the fraction of curve attributable to rod adaptation disappears can be explained by the photochromatic interval. The photochromatic interval is a measure of the difference in sensitivities between the photopic system and the scotopic system for a given wavelength. The scotopic system is more sensitive than the photopic system for all wavelengths, except those that are perceived as red (the longer wavelengths like 650 nm). Within this region of the spectrum, the photochromatic interval is essentially zero. Therefore, because the scotopic system is not more sensitive than the photopic system when using a stimulus of 650 nm, there is no rod-cone break."

      "question": "Which of the following color vision tests is able to differentiate between a dichromat and an anomalous trichromat?",
      "options": [" The desaturated D-15 test  ", " The anomaloscope  ", " Pseudoisochromatic plates  ", " The Farnsworth dichotomous test  "],
      "answers": [" The anomaloscope  "],
      "explanation": "Pseudoisochromatic plate tests are the most frequently used color tests in the clinical setting. They are relatively easy and quick to use. In essence, a figure (usually a symbol, number or letter) must be discerned from a background using color as a cue to help create contours. Patients who suffer from a color defect will be unable to see the figure. The one drawback to this test is that very few renditions of this test offer the ability to detect blue-yellow deficits. &#10;&#10;The Farnsworth dichotomous test is comprised of 15 colored caps. The patient is asked to place the caps in order of a sequence of successive hues. The manner in which the caps are placed allows the clinician to determine if the patient is a deutan, protan or tritan because each defect will cause a mix-up of the colors in a specific manner according to the patient's respective confusion lines. &#10;&#10;The desaturated D-15 test is the same as the Farnsworth except that the hues are desaturated, making the test more difficult but enabling the clinician to detect certain pathologies such as glaucoma. &#10;&#10;The Nagel anomaloscope is the only clinical device capable of distinguishing a dichromat from an anomalous trichromat. The patient looks through an eyepiece and assesses a split field. The upper portion consists of a mixture of green and red (which are variable) with a fixed luminance. The lower portion of the field displays a yellow color whose radiance can be manipulated. The wavelengths in both fields stimulate only the M- and L-cones, effectively rendering all persons dichromats. Normal trichromats are fairly consistent with the values to which they will assign to both of the fields. How the wavelengths of the mixture field and the radiance values are manipulated by the patient allows the clinician to differentiate between a dichromat and an anomalous trichromat.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Color Vision Anomalies"

      "explanation": "Rods are found at their highest concentration 20 degrees from the fovea. The fovea itself does not contain any rods, hence the reason we are unable to see a dim star with foveal fixation but looking slightly away from it allows for detection of the dim object. This is because we place the object on the part of our retina where there is maximal sensitivity, or 20 degrees from the fovea.

      "options": [" The fovea  ", " The peripheral retina   ", " The ora serrata  ", " The optic nerve head  "],
      "answers": [" The peripheral retina   "],
      "explanation": "The peripheral retina is most sensitive to flicker because it is a part of the magno system which is also known as the 'where' system. The magno system is noted for its poor spatial resolution but good temporal resolution. The fact that the peripheral retina is more sensitive to flicker is in accordance with the Granit-Harper law, which states that as the log of the area of the stimulus is increased, the critical flicker fusion frequency also increases accordingly. This helps to explain why the chances of perceiving flicker are greater for a larger stimulus for a given modulation. Remember that the receptors of the peripheral retina display increased summation; therefore, a larger stimulus will take up more area of the retina, increasing the chances of detection."

      ],
      "answers": [" The information from many rods cells is summated indirectly onto one ganglion cell  "],
      "explanation": "Spatial summation is utilized by the scotopic system and allows for greater sensitivity at the cost of resolution. Information from several rods across space is funneled indirectly onto one ganglion cell (rods do not directly synapse onto ganglion cells). Because the information is received from several rods, this combines to increase the chances of detecting an object (i.e., increased sensitivity). However, because the area over which the information is gathered is large and the information is sent to one ganglion cell, the resolution is poor. This is in opposition to the photopic system, which displays a much smaller degree of spatial summation, leading to decreased sensitivity but greater resolution. For example, two lights that are flashed close together in both time and space will be coded as one flash by the scotopic system because the information is sent to one ganglion cell. However, the same stimuli will be perceived as two lights by the photopic system due to the stimulation of two adjacent ganglion cells, thereby enabling this system to code for two different stimuli, resulting in greater resolution. &#10;&#10;The receptive field of a ganglion cell is antagonistic and is either on-center surrounded by off-surround or off-center surrounded by on-surround.&#10;"

      "explanation": "All of the above methods suffer from the drawback of variable observer threshold criterion except for the forced choice method. The brilliance of this method lies in the fact that no matter what the observer's criterion level, the observer must respond. In the forced choice method, the observer must choose between several options, one of which displays the stimulus. For example, an observer is presented with four windows and they must choose which window contains the stimulus. &#10;&#10;The method of ascending limits presents a stimulus below threshold, gradually increasing its intensity until it is reported as visible by the observer. This method is flawed in that the observer begins to report seeing the stimulus due to expectations. This inherent flaw can be overcome by varying the intensity of the initial stimulus at the beginning of each trial. &#10;&#10;The method of descending limits is similar to the method of ascending limits except that the stimulus is changed to visible from non-visible. The drawbacks and the solutions are identical to the method of ascending limits. &#10;&#10;The method of constant stimuli gives valuable information but requires a lot of time.

      "question": "What is the name for the phenomenon in which a flickering light that is 10 Hz is seen as brighter than a steady light (one that does not flicker) that possesses the same average luminance?",
      "options": [" The Troxler effect  ", " The Purkinje tree  ", " The Brucke-Bartley effect   ", " The Granit-Harper law  "],
      "answers": [" The Brucke-Bartley effect   "],
      "explanation": "The Brucke-Bartley effect describes the fact that a flickering stimulus that is 10 Hz will appear brighter than a non-flickering light with the same average luminance. This fact also holds true for stimulus presentation duration. A light that is presented for 50 milliseconds will appear brighter than stimuli presented for longer or shorter durations. &#10;&#10;The Troxler effect occurs when the eye is fixated (although the eye is truly always moving) on a point in space and the surrounding background begins to blend together. There must be several factors that come into play in order for the Troxler effect to transpire. The best example of this phenomenon is the figure in which there are two squares that are superimposed. The smaller square is centered in the larger square and is slightly lighter than the larger surrounding square. The border between the squares is blurred, resulting in a distinction of the two squares based upon brightness alone. When fixating upon an X placed in the center of the smaller square, the border completely disappears as does the smaller square, resulting in the perception of one uniformly-colored large square. Some patients experience the Troxler effect while performing the FDT visual field and they report, especially during testing of the second eye, that the entire field appears to go gray. When this occurs make sure to inform the patient to blink. &#10;&#10;The peripheral retina is most sensitive to flicker because it is a part of the magno system which is also known as the 'where' system. The magno system is noted for its poor spatial resolution but good temporal resolution. The fact that the peripheral retina is more sensitive to flicker is in accordance with the Granit-Harper law, which states that as the log of the area of the stimulus is increased, the critical flicker fusion frequency also increases accordingly. This helps to explain why the chances of perceiving flicker are greater for a larger stimulus for a given modulation. Remember that the receptors of the peripheral retina display increased summation; therefore, a larger stimulus will take up more area of the retina, increasing the chances of detection. &#10;&#10;Due to the fact that the eye does not respond well to low temporal frequencies, stabilized retinal images are unable to be detected. Blood vessels that lie on top of the photoreceptors are considered stable relative to the retina. However, if you shine a penlight against your eyelid and move it rapidly, you will be able to see the shadows cast by the blood vessels on your retina. This is called a Purkinje tree. The penlight must be moving to ensure that the temporal frequency is great enough to be visualized."

      "question": "During a saccadic movement, which of the following pathways is MOST likely selectively suppressed?",
      "options": [" The ventral processing pathway  ", " The magno pathway   ", " The temporal pathway  ", " The parvo pathway  "],
      "answers": [" The magno pathway   "],
      "explanation": "While performing a saccade, vision is suppressed just before, during, and just after the saccadic motion. This ensures that the background does not appear as a blurred image. It is postulated that selective suppression of the magno pathway maintains a clear retinal image during eye movements. In terms of function, this makes sense because the magno pathway is considered the 'where' pathway and responds to quickly-moving objects as well as high temporal frequencies, both of which occur to the background during a saccade.&#10;The ventral processing stream (also known as the temporal pathway or the 'what' system) receives a vast majority of its input from parvo cells, which respond preferentially to low temporal frequencies."

      "answers": [" The viewing of objects that lie significantly in front of a horopter   "],
      "explanation": "Stereopsis is based upon binocular disparity within a certain limit that causes the perception of depth. In order for binocular fusion to occur, retinal images must remain within Panum's fusional area, which denotes the area of the retina that will result in fusion. Each point on the retina of one eye corresponds to a point on the retina of the other eye, called corresponding points. For a given object distance, if each corresponding point is plotted, a curved line called a horopter will be generated. An object placed at any location along the horopter will result in fusion. If the object is placed too far ahead or behind the horopter, physiological diplopia will occur. If an object is located slightly ahead or behind the horopter and falls within Panum's fusional area, the resulting retinal disparity will produce stereopsis."

      "explanation": "Observers possess different levels of threshold criterion. The threshold levels can be influenced by the level of noise within a person's visual system. Each of us has baseline neural activation which fluctuates. In order for a signal to be detected, it must be distinguishable from the background neural noise. The signal detection theory states that there are two distributions--one is comprised of the neural noise, the other is the signal added to the neural noise. The theory demonstrates that as the detectability of the signal increases, the difference, or the separation between the two distributions, also increases. If there is a lot of overlap between the curves then there is a smaller chance of the signal being detected."

      "explanation": "The Munsell color system can be visualized as a cylinder. Chroma represents the purity of the color or its saturation. On the cylinder, chroma is located at the radius of the center of the cylinder and increases as one moves away from the center. Otherwise stated, the calorimetric purity increases as one moves more distally from the center of the cylinder. Hue is used to describe the wavelength. On the cylinder, hue is located along the perimeter of the cylinder. Value denotes the brightness of the stimulus. Value is located along the length of the cylinder and increases from black to white with various shades of grey in between."

      "options": [" Violet  ", " Red   ", " Green  ", " Yellow  ", " Blue  "],
      "answers": [" Red   "],
      "explanation": "As one moves to the right in the electromagnetic spectrum, the wavelengths progressively decrease while the frequency of the emitted radiation increases. On the left of the spectrum are radio waves; moving to the right we find radio waves, microwaves, and infrared light (IR). Sandwiched between IR and ultraviolet light is the visible portion of the spectrum; it is truly a very small slice of the entire spectrum. As we continue to the right, we encounter x-rays then gamma rays, which are very high in frequency but possess a small wavelength. Radiation emitted by rays at the far right of the spectrum can be quite dangerous. Remember the mnemonic ROY G BIV. This will help you to remember color wavelengths because red possesses the longest wavelength and appears first on the electromagnetic spectrum while violet is last with the smallest wavelength. Red is roughly 650 nm, orange 600 nm, yellow 570 nm, green 520 nm, blue 470 nm and violet 400 nm."

      "question": "A 1' arc test spot is presented to an observer and is detected by the observer's scotopic system; a second 5' arc test spot emitting the same number of quanta as the previous test spot is also detected by the observer. The amount of quanta necessary for detection by the scotopic system remains constant for stimuli that are below 10' arc. This observation is an example of which of the following laws?",
      "options": [" Weber's law  ", " Bloch's law  ", " Ricco's law   ", " The cosine law  "],
      "answers": [" Ricco's law   "],
      "explanation": "Ricco's law holds only for stimuli that are below a critical diameter. Mathematically, the relationship is expressed as, IA=K, with I= stimulus intensity (quanta/area), A= stimulus area, and K=constant. Therefore, according to Ricco's law, the threshold number of quanta necessary for stimulus detection is constant, with stimulus intensity and stimulus area having a reciprocal relationship. As the value of I increases, the value of A must decrease in order for K to remain the same. Therefore, as the area of the stimulus increases (as long as it remains below the critical diameter), the stimulus intensity must decrease such that the value of K remains constant. &#10;&#10;Weber's Law deals with the just noticeable difference and can be expressed mathematically as K= delta I/I, where K= Weber's constant, delta I= that difference threshold, and I= the original stimulus intensity (weight, etc.). &#10;&#10;Bloch's law applies to temporal summation and therefore to stimuli that are separated by time. According to Bloch, as long as stimuli are presented within a critical period (100 msec for the scotopic system and 10-50 msec for the photopic system), the total number of quanta necessary for threshold to be reached remains the same for different flash durations. Mathematically the relationship is expressed as, I(t)=K where I= stimulus intensity (quanta/time), t= stimulus duration, and K= constant. For this relationship to hold true, I and t are inversely proportional to each other. As the stimulus intensity increases, the flash duration must decrease."

      "options": [" Xanthopsia  ", " A sine wave grating  ", " Mach bands   ", " Nyquist sampling theorem  "],
      "answers": [" Mach bands   "],
      "explanation": "Mach bands are typically observed when there is a smooth transition between white/gray to black. Bands are perceived within the transition zones. These bands are created by the visual system due to the augmentation of high spatial frequencies. This augmentation results in the perception of bands or bars at transition zones. &#10;&#10;Xanthopsia is a type of chromatopsia generally induced by certain medications and causes the appearance of a yellow tinge to everything. &#10;&#10;Photoreceptors that are more tightly packed are able to discern a greater amount of detail than those that are loosely packed. Think of alternating light and dark bands. In order to properly appreciate these bands, one bright band must fall on one photoreceptor and an adjacent dark band must stimulate an adjacent receptor. If the receptors are too big or loosely packed, a light band may fall on half of one receptor and half of another; receptors then sum the information, causing a loss of visual information and the inability to properly discern the grating. The above is referred to as the Nyquist sampling theorem."

Within this region of the spectrum, the photochromatic interval is essentially zero. An interesting fact to note is that for wavelengths measuring greater than 650 nm, the photopic system is actually more sensitive than the scotopic system, causing a reversal of the photochromatic interval.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Photoreceptors"

      "answers": [" Dark adaptation by the cones   "],
      "explanation": "In order to generate a dark adaptation curve, an observer is exposed to a bright light that bleaches almost all of the photopigments. Once the light is turned off, the observer is left in a totally dark room and asked to detect large, centrally fixated, flashing stimuli allowing for detection threshold as a function of time to be measured. The result is a dark adaptation curve. The initial portion of the curve displays a rapid decrease in threshold during the first five minutes, which correlates with the regeneration of cone pigments and cone thresholds. The curve then plateaus and is followed by another, more gradual decrease in threshold after 10 minutes. This section of the curve is called the rod-cone break at which point the rods become more sensitive than the cones. The second dip is caused by regeneration of the rods, allowing detection of the stimulus. Cones take about 10 minutes to fully recover; rods have a total recovery time of 35 minutes. &#10;&#10;(Image adapted from Hecht S, Shlaer S and Pirenne M. Energy, Quanta, and Vision.

This technique involves presenting infants with two visual stimuli and observing their preferences, assuming that infants will look longer at stimuli they find more interesting or are able to see more clearly.&#10;&#10;Regarding visual acuity, research shows that infants' visual acuity improves over the first few years of life. While newborns have relatively poor vision, by around 6 months, they can see much better and can detect patterns, faces, and contrasts more clearly. However, their visual acuity continues to develop beyond the first year, and it generally reaches adult-like levels by around 3 to 5 years of age (36 to 60 months). At this stage, children typically have near-adult levels of sharpness in vision, meaning their ability to distinguish fine details is on par with that of an adult.&#10;&#10;Thus, the period between 36 and 60 months is when visual acuity reaches maturity."

These interblob regions receive their primary input from layer 4B.&#10;Layer 4B receives input from the magnocellular pathway, which is associated with processing motion and depth.&#10;Layer 4C, on the other hand, primarily receives input from the parvocellular pathway, which is involved in color and fine detail processing and sends its outputs to the blob regions of the cortex, not the interblob regions.&#10;Thus, the interblob regions mainly receive their primary input from layer 4B."

      "explanation": "Blindsight refers to a condition where individuals who are clinically blind due to damage in the primary visual cortex (V1) can still respond to visual stimuli in ways that are not consciously perceived. These individuals are typically unable to consciously see or report objects in their visual field, yet they can demonstrate the ability to detect or localize stimuli above the level of chance.&#10;&#10;When tested using a forced-choice procedure (where the patient is given two or more options to choose from), a person with blindsight tends to perform above chance. This means they can correctly identify or respond to visual stimuli at a rate higher than random guessing would predict, even though they do not have conscious awareness of the stimuli. The ability to perform above chance suggests that some unconscious visual processing is still occurring, likely through pathways other than the damaged primary visual cortex, such as the superior colliculus or other subcortical structures involved in visual processing.&#10;&#10;In contrast, chance performance (answer b) would indicate that the patient was unable to detect the stimulus in a way that exceeds random guessing, which does not typically occur in blindsight.&#10;&#10;Random responses (answer c) imply a lack of any systematic response, which also wouldn't align with the typical findings of blindsight, where the patient is able to demonstrate some level of visual ability despite lacking conscious vision."

      "explanation": "A psychometric function typically describes the relationship between stimulus intensity (or some other stimulus characteristic) and the likelihood of a correct response. It is commonly used in sensory testing to assess how well a subject can detect a stimulus at various intensities.&#10;&#10;In the case of ocular disease, which affects vision, the slope of the psychometric function typically decreases. This means that individuals with ocular diseases may have a reduced ability to discriminate between different stimulus intensities. As a result, their performance becomes less sensitive to changes in the stimulus intensity, which makes the slope of their psychometric function flatter.&#10;&#10;Steeper slopes usually indicate that the individual can distinguish between small differences in stimulus intensity with high sensitivity.&#10;Flatter slopes (i.e., a decrease in the slope) indicate that the individual is less sensitive to changes in stimulus intensity and may require more significant differences in the stimulus to perceive them.&#10;Ocular diseases, such as cataracts, macular degeneration, or glaucoma, impair visual processing, leading to reduced sensitivity to visual stimuli. This reduction in sensitivity causes the slope of the psychometric function to decrease, as it becomes harder for the individual to detect differences in visual stimuli."

      "options": ["a. luminance remains constant", "b. radiance remains constant", "c. both luminance and radiance remain constant"],
      "answers": ["a. luminance remains constant"],
      "explanation": "The Nagel anomaloscope is a device used to assess color vision and specifically to diagnose color vision deficiencies, particularly red-green color deficiencies. The test works by asking the subject to match the color of a mixture of red and green light with a reference yellow light.&#10;&#10;In the context of the Nagel anomaloscope, the term 'mixture field' refers to the adjustable portion of the device where the subject mixes red and green lights to match the yellow light.&#10;&#10;Luminance refers to the perceived brightness of the light. When adjusting the mixture of red and green in the anomaloscope, the luminance of the mixture field remains constant. This means that while the hue (the color) of the mixture changes as the ratio of red and green light is adjusted, the overall brightness of the field doesn't change, ensuring that the color match is based on hue, not brightness.&#10;&#10;Radiance, on the other hand, refers to the total power of light emitted per unit area and can change as the red and green light intensities are adjusted.&#10;&#10;Therefore, as the mixture field of the anomaloscope is adjusted, the luminance remains constant, while the radiance (which includes both the intensity and the spectrum of the light) can change depending on the adjustment of the red and green components."

      "options": ["a. ocular dominance and orientation columns", "b. thin and thick dark stripes", "c. blobs"],
      "answers": ["a. ocular dominance and orientation columns"],
      "explanation": "hypercolumn is a concept in the organization of the visual cortex, specifically in the striate cortex (V1). It refers to a small, repeating unit of the cortical structure that contains a complete set of visual processing information for a given region of the visual field. This includes:&#10;&#10;Ocular Dominance Columns: These columns correspond to the dominance of input from either the left or right eye. In the striate cortex, neurons are organized into columns that preferentially respond to input from one eye or the other, alternating across the cortex in a columnar fashion.&#10;&#10;Orientation Columns: These columns correspond to the preference of neurons for particular orientations of edges or lines. Neurons within each column are tuned to a specific angle of line orientation, and this preference is mapped across the visual cortex in a systematic way.&#10;&#10;A hypercolumn contains all the information required to process the visual input from a specific part of the visual field, combining ocular dominance and orientation columns, making it a functional unit for processing both depth (binocular input) and the basic visual features like edges and lines.&#10;&#10;Why the other options are incorrect:&#10;b. Thin and thick dark stripes: These are actually a feature of the organization of the visual areas V2 and not a defining feature of a hypercolumn in V1. These stripes are associated with processing different aspects of visual stimuli, but they do not directly define a hypercolumn.&#10;&#10;c. Blobs: Blobs are areas in V1 that are involved in color processing, particularly related to the parvocellular pathway, but a hypercolumn does not specifically contain just the blobs; it refers to a larger unit that incorporates ocular dominance, orientation columns, and sometimes blobs.&#10;&#10;Thus, the correct definition of a hypercolumn is a region that includes both ocular dominance and orientation columns."

      "options": ["a. simultaneous masking", "b. metacontrast", "c. paracontrast"],
      "answers": ["a. simultaneous masking"],
      "explanation": "Amblyopia, commonly known as 'lazy eye,' is a condition where the vision in one eye doesn't develop properly during early childhood, leading to decreased visual acuity that cannot be fully corrected with glasses or contact lenses. One of the key aspects of amblyopia is that the brain favors the stronger eye, and the weaker eye is often not used effectively for visual tasks.&#10;&#10;When measuring visual acuity, there is a difference between how a person with amblyopia performs on a Snellen chart versus when the optotypes (letters or symbols) are presented in isolation.&#10;&#10;Snellen chart: The letters on the Snellen chart are often displayed in a sequence or in a crowded arrangement, which can cause difficulty in visual processing. For patients with amblyopia, the interaction between multiple letters and the visual field can lead to interference in recognition. This is known as simultaneous masking, where the presence of surrounding letters or stimuli reduces the ability of the amblyopic eye to resolve the target letter clearly.&#10;&#10;Isolated optotypes: When the target letters are presented in isolation (one letter at a time), there is less visual interference from surrounding stimuli, allowing the patient to focus on the individual letter and perform better. This minimizes the effect of simultaneous masking.&#10;&#10;Why the other options are incorrect:&#10;b. Metacontrast: This refers to a phenomenon where an object is presented briefly and is followed by a second stimulus that contrasts with the first, but this second stimulus does not overlap with the first. Metacontrast mainly affects the perception of temporal stimuli rather than spatial stimuli like optotypes on a Snellen chart.&#10;&#10;c. Paracontrast: This term refers to the effect where objects are perceived more clearly when they are surrounded by a field of stimuli that are similar to them. Paracontrast is less relevant to the case of amblyopia, where the issue is primarily related to interference from surrounding stimuli rather than enhancement from similar surrounding fields.&#10;&#10;Thus, the poorer visual acuity in amblyopic patients when using a Snellen chart is primarily due to simultaneous masking, where the presence of multiple nearby optotypes reduces the clarity of the target optotype."

However, if the mother is not a carrier herself, her daughters will only be carriers but will not display the phenotype associated with the genetic defect because it is recessive and they will inherit a normal X from their mother. It is for this reason that females rarely express an X-linked genetic defect, while males are affected to a much higher degree."

      "answers": [" 130 mg/dL   "],
      "explanation": "Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels can be translated to an estimated average blood sugar level, which can help a patient and doctor better understand the values and more easily compare them to random and fasting blood sugar levels. &#10;&#10;An easy way to remember this conversion is to begin with an HbA1c value of 5.0, which corresponds to an average blood sugar value of approximately 100mg/dL. For each increase in the HbA1c of 1.0, the estimated average blood sugar value increases by a factor of about 30. In this case, an A1c level of 6.0% would correspond to an average blood sugar of about 130mg/dL. &#10;&#10;This is a table with the actual conversion values: &#10;5 % = 97 mg/dL &#10;6 % = 126 mg/dL &#10;7 % = 154 mg/dL &#10;8 % = 183 mg/dL &#10;9 % = 212 mg/dL &#10;10 % = 240 mg/dL &#10;11 % = 269 mg/dL &#10;12 % = 298 mg/dL &#10;13 % = 326 mg/dL &#10;14 % = 355 mg/dL &#10;&#10;For someone who does not have diabetes, a normal A1c level will typically range from 4.5 to 6.0%, while a person who has had uncontrolled diabetes for several years may have an A1c level of closer to 8.0 or 9.0%. &#10;&#10;When A1c levels are used to help in the diagnosis of diabetes, a value of 6.5% or higher on two separate occasions indicates that the patient has diabetes (5.7 to 6.4% is considered pre-diabetic). For most patients who have been diagnosed with diabetes, a common treatment target level tends to be 7.0%; however higher or lower targets may be recommended in certain cases."

      "explanation": "According to the American Diabetes Association, the A1c test provides a measurement that reflects the average blood glucose level over a period of 2-3 months. This is in contrast to a fasting blood sugar measurement, in which the level reflects only the blood glucose level at that specific moment. A1c measurements are used for monitoring how well a patient's treatment plan is working and for making decisions on further management for each individual case. The A1c measurement also tends to be more convenient for patients in that it does not require fasting and may be performed at any time during the day. Normal A1c levels are typically below 5.7%, while patients are considered pre-diabetic if their A1c levels are between 5.7% and 6.5%. Patients who exhibit an A1c level above 6.5% on at least two measurements are diagnosed as having diabetes."

      "explanation": "Because the father is homozygous-dominant, it is indicated that he possesses a dominant gene pair for the chin fissure trait (FF). On the other hand, the mother is homozygous-recessive for this trait; therefore, phenotypically she would have a 'normal chin' because she has an identical gene pair that does not code for a chin fissure (ff). Each child would receive an allele from each parent, but the pair of genes would not be identical (this is termed heterozygous (Ff)). &#10;&#10;However, because they would inherit a dominant form of the allele, this is the form of the gene that would influence the phenotype, resulting in the appearance of a chin fissure."

      "explanation": "Patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of giant cell arteritis (GCA) should immediately undergo erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) testing. Although there are no positively definitive studies on the range of ESR in normal patients, there is a formula that allows an estimation of the normal maximum ESR, which is dependent on gender and age. &#10;&#10;- For females, the maximum ESR can be calculated by adding 10 to her age and then dividing that number by two &#10;- For males, the maximum ESR is equivalent to his age divided by two &#10;&#10;Even if ESR testing is normal in patients exhibiting symptoms of GCA, these patients should still undergo a temporal artery biopsy due to the fact that 8-22% of patients with biopsy-proven GCA will show a normal ESR. Additionally, it is important to remember that an elevated ESR is not specific for GCA as it may occur in several other types of inflammatory diseases; however, an elevated ESR with an elevated CRP is considered much more sensitive in diagnosing GCA."

      "explanation": "A bruit is a 'whooshing' sound that may be heard between quick beats of the heart (mid-systole), commonly representing irregular flow of blood around a thrombus in the carotid artery. However, many carotid bruits are discovered incidentally in an asymptomatic patient, and the presence of a bruit does not necessarily indicate artery stenosis. On the other hand, the absence of a bruit does not rule out the possibility of carotid artery occlusion, because a bruit is unlikely to be heard if the stenosis blocks less than 40-50% of the diameter of the artery, as there is not enough turbulence to be heard. It is also unlikely to be heard if the stenosis is more than 85-90% (as the flow may be too low).

      "answers": [" An immune complex hypersensitivity reaction involving the interaction of circulating antigen-antibody complexes in blood vessel walls causing neutrophil emigration and tissue damage   "],
      "explanation": "There are four types of hypersensitivity reactions. Type III is characterized by antigen-antibody complexes. Type I is the immediate hypersensitivity reaction mediated by IgE. Type II involves IgG and body tissues (i.e. RBCs). The delayed hypersensitivity reaction (Type IV) involves the presentation of antigen through antigen-presenting cells to lymphocytes."

      "answers": [" An immature macrophage located in the blood   "],
      "explanation": "There are two major classes of leukocytes: granulocytes and agranulocytes. Neutrophils, basophils and eosinophils all fall under the category of granulocytes due to the fact that they contain a lobed nucleus and possess cytoplasmic granules visible upon staining. &#10;&#10;The second class of leukocytes is agranulocytes, aptly named because they do not possess cytoplasmic granules. This class contains two types of cells, monocytes and lymphocytes. Monocytes are immature macrophages that move into an infection site and divide and differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells that destroy microbes and debris via phagocytosis. Lymphocytes, the T cells and the B cells, are involved in hosting specific immune responses. &#10;&#10;Basophils release histamine, along with other substances, that prolong the inflammatory response."

      "question": "A father brings in his two-year old son for evaluation at your office. The father remarks that his son was born with what appears as a small red birthmark on his forehead. He wishes to know if it requires treatment or warrants removal. Applying pressure over the area of interest causes blanching of the lesion, and the father reports that the birthmark appears darker when his son cries. What is your prognosis?",

      ],
      "answers": [" Benign and will likely regress by the time the child is 5 years of age   "],
      "explanation": "The above findings describe a capillary hemangioma (also called a strawberry mark), which is a patch of blood vessels or a vascular birthmark. Most hemangiomas occur at birth or shortly thereafter. There are several different types of hemangiomas, but the most common is the capillary type. The capillary hemangioma will blanch with applied pressure and tends to change color with Valsalva maneuvers, crying, or straining due to changes in blood flow. The majority of these types of vascular lesions will regress by the time the child is 5 years old. If the lesion is still present past puberty, then the lesion is likely permanent and may be removed if the patient is unhappy with the cosmesis."

      "answers": [" A sarcomere   "],
      "explanation": "A sarcomere is the functional unit of a muscle contraction. Myofibrils are composed of multiple sarcomeres. Within one sarcomere are small filaments called actin and myosin that slide past each other resulting in motion. &#10;&#10;Multiple molecules of myosin form a thick filament with the myosin head exposed. Actin proteins form thin filaments. Upon contraction of a muscle, a cross bridge forms between the heads, shortening the sarcomere length."

      "options": [" Acetylcholine   ", " Glutamate  ", " Serotonin  ", " Dopamine  "],
      "answers": [" Acetylcholine   "],
      "explanation": "For muscle contraction to occur, Acetylcholine (ACh) is released from the presynaptic terminals of the motor neurons. At the neuromuscular junction, the neuron becomes stimulated, and calcium causes vesicles that contain ACh to fuse with axon endings and release ACh into the synapse. The ACh then binds with receptors on the muscle cell membrane, resulting in muscle contraction. &#10;&#10;Depleted levels of serotonin have been correlated with depression. &#10;&#10;Dopamine is a type of catecholamine and plays a large role in Parkinson's disease. This neurotransmitter, if injected intravenously, also stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and causes increased heart rate and blood pressure. Overall dopamine plays a large role in cognition, memory, motivation, and mood to name a few functions. &#10;&#10;Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and plays an important role in learning and memory."

      "explanation": "Herpes zoster occurs most frequently in patients in their 6th and 7th decades of life. Younger patients presenting with this condition should prompt further testing for possible immunodeficiency, as the development of herpes zoster does not typically occur in children or young adults. Other conditions that may lead to early development of herpes zoster include malignancy (leukemia or lymphoma), patients who have undergone bone marrow or other organ transplantation, or those who are concurrently taking immunosuppressive medications (steroids or chemotherapy)."

      "explanation": "In up to 95% of patients diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the cancer cells contain a chromosomal abnormality known as the Philadelphia chromosome (named after the city where it was discovered). The Philadelphia chromosome results from a reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 9 and 22. In the 5% of CML patients who do not exhibit the classic Philadelphia chromosome, there are translocations involving the same chromosomal regions, but these appear to be structurally more complex. &#10;&#10;The Philadelphia chromosome is highly sensitive for CML because 95% of CML patients posses this abnormality; however, the chromosome can also be present in a subset of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) or (occasionally) in those with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Therefore, the presence of the chromosome is not sufficiently specific to diagnose CML. &#10;&#10;Principles of Cancer Genetics. Bunz, F. 2008. Springer Science + Business Media. Baltimore, MD."

      "options": [" Acute lymphocytic leukemia   ", " Chronic lymphocytic leukemia  ", " Acute myelocytic leukemia  ", " Chronic myelocytic leukemia  "],
      "answers": [" Acute lymphocytic leukemia   "],
      "explanation": "Acute lymphocytic (lymphoblastic) leukemia (ALL): This type of leukemia predominantly affects children but can affect adults as well (typically over the age of 65). The standard treatment for ALL involves chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Survival rates for children are very high, as about 85-90% of cases respond to treatment and close to 70% of patients become cured. Prognosis is more guarded in older populations, with an observed survival rate of about 50%. &#10;&#10;An easy way to remember the answer to this question is that 'ALL kids survive' (in ALL cases, the prognosis for children is very good). &#10;&#10;Acute myelocytic (myeloblastic) leukemia (AML): AML is most frequently found in older populations and rarely affects children. The treatment of choice in these cases is chemotherapy, and remission rates are about 30% (for those under the age of 60). &#10;&#10;Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL): CLL typically affects adults over the age of 55. It may rarely affect younger adults, but almost never occurs in children. There is no cure for this type of leukemia, but there are many effective treatments. CLL has a very chronic course and is not typically fatal. &#10;&#10;Chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML): CML more frequently affects older populations more frequently than younger adults or children. It has a progressive, chronic course with a less favorable prognosis. The mainstay of treatment for these patients is imatinib (a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor)."

      "answers": [" Afferent arteriole-> glomerulus-> proximal tubule-> loop of Henle-> distal tubule-> collecting duct   "],
      "explanation": "Blood is delivered to the kidneys via the renal artery, which eventually branches into many afferent arterioles. One afferent arteriole is linked with one nephron. The afferent arteriole then branches to form capillary clusters; these form the glomerulus, which filters into the glomerular capsule. The glomerulus capillaries then leave the capsule by way of the efferent arteriole, which branches into the peritubular capillaries for cortical nephrons; the efferent arteriole branches into the vasa recta for juxtamedullary nephrons. The peritubular capillaries and vasa recta surround the tubular parts of the nephron and reabsorb water and solutes from the tubule. The capillaries then merge into venules and carry filtered blood away from the kidneys. Water and solutes leave the blood from the glomerulus and are carried from Bowman's capsule to the proximal tubule then into the loop of Henle, where they continue their journey to the distal tubule. The filtrate is then transferred to the collecting duct."

The testicles possess receptors for these two hormones. LH stimulates Leydig cells to synthesize more testosterone (causing an increase in sperm levels); FSH release acts upon Sertoli cells, which help to nourish developing sperm. When testosterone levels increase, a negative feedback loop is created wherein GnRH production decreases. When sperm levels are high, Sertoli cells release inhibin which inhibits the release of GnRH and FSH."

Characteristic signs of this disease include numbness, fatigue, and muscle weakness. Vision may also be affected. In your office, always analyze visual fields; an altitudinal defect may be associated with multiple sclerosis. Optic neuritis is also a commonly linked with MS. &#10;&#10;Epilepsy can result from drug use, trauma, or infection. A common cause for epilepsy cannot be identified. Epilepsy occurs due to abnormal brain activity, leading to seizures. &#10;&#10;Alzheimer's disease is associated with memory loss, confusion, and dementia.

      "question": "Alteration of the electric gradient across an axon's membrane such that the inside becomes momentarily positively charged relative to the outside of the membrane is known as which of the following terms?",
      "options": [" An action potential   ", " A stimulus  ", " Resting potential  ", " Saltatory conduction  "],
      "answers": [" An action potential   "],
      "explanation": "An action potential is triggered when enough input summates to cause a reversal of the voltage difference across the axonal membrane, causing the inside of the cell to briefly become positively charged relative to the outside of the cell. &#10;&#10;The resting potential of a typical neuron is roughly -70 millivolts. This electric charge is maintained across the membrane in a cell that is at rest and thus is not undergoing an action potential. &#10;&#10;A stimulus, if it reaches the threshold level, is capable of causing an action potential but is not an action potential itself. &#10;&#10;The nodes of Ranvier are the naked portions of the axon that are not enveloped in myelin sheath. It is here at the nodes where the action potential conduction occurs. Once an action potential is initiated, it spreads down the axon and actually jumps from node to node between the myelinated sections. This is termed saltatory conduction, which in Latin means 'to jump'. The nodes contain high numbers of voltage-gated sodium channels. It is via this manner that myelination increases the conduction speed of an action potential."

      "options": [" An epidemic  ", " An endemic  ", " Sporadic  ", " A pandemic   "],
      "answers": [" A pandemic   "],
      "explanation": "A pandemic is defined as an epidemic breakout of a disease across a large geographical area (i.e. several countries) for a given time span. An example of a pandemic disease is AIDS. &#10;&#10;An epidemic is a rapid outbreak of a disease that affects many individuals at the same time and is well above a predicted rate for a given area or community. &#10;&#10;Sporadic diseases don't occur very often and affect very few individuals. &#10;&#10;Endemic diseases are those that occur frequently or continuously with predictability.

      "question": "During which phase of the cell cycle does DNA replication occur?",
      "options": [" Anaphase  ", " Interphase   ", " Prophase  ", " Telophase  ", " Metaphase  "],
      "answers": [" Interphase   "],
      "explanation": "The first stage of mitosis is prophase. During early prophase, DNA begins to condense inside of a nuclear envelope. During late prophase, the process involves further condensation of the chromosomes, the beginning of breakdown of the nuclear envelope, and the movement of one of a pair of centrioles to the other pole of the cell. During the transition into metaphase (sometimes called prometaphase), the centrioles send out microtubules, forming a spindle apparatus which attaches to sister chromatids of each chromosome. The microtubules attach at a site called a kinetochore on the centromere. At this time, the nuclear envelope has completely disintegrated. Metaphase is marked by the chromosomes aligning along the cellular equator, guided by the microtubules. Anaphase follows. During this phase, the sister chromatids of each chromosome are pulled apart and are directed to opposite poles towards the centrioles by the microtubules. This is now telophase. During this stage, the chromosomes are no longer attached to the microtubules and begin to become less condensed. Nuclear envelopes also form around the de-condensing chromosomes, separating the DNA from the cytoplasm. At this point, cytoplasmic division begins and is generally complete before the end of telophase. Both new cells are diploid and contain the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. The cells then transition into interphase, in which the DNA is duplicated and the cytoplasm and its components increase in number. Interphase is the longest portion of the cell cycle and is not a part of mitosis. After interphase, the cell will then either move on to mitosis, or it will no longer divide."

      "answers": [" T lymphocytes   "],
      "explanation": "The innate immune system relies on natural anatomical barriers, the production of antimicrobial peptides, phagocytic activities by neutrophils (among other cell types), non-specific activation of complement, and the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns that are then presented to pattern recognition receptors. Although the latter process involves pattern recognition, it differs from the adaptive immune system in that it only recognizes highly conserved microbial structures. Neutrophils phagocytose foreign materials and utilize oxidative burst to neutralize microbes. Other cells involved that are considered phagocytes include mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. T lymphocytes' main function involves cell-mediated immunity and regulating humoral immunity."

      "options": [" Angina pectoris  ", " Arteriosclerosis  ", " Atherosclerosis   ", " Arrhythmia  "],
      "answers": [" Atherosclerosis   "],
      "explanation": "When excess cholesterol or other lipids build up on the inside of the arterial wall, the lumen of that blood vessel narrows. This narrowing can become aggravated if a platelet becomes stuck on the rough edges of the plaque stimulating a blood clot. The artery may become so clogged that blood flow is impeded and the tissue or organs normally supplied by the vessel may become ischemic. If a coronary artery is affected, chest pains (angina pectoris) or a heart attack may ensue. Atherosclerosis is a type of arteriosclerosis. &#10;&#10;Arteriosclerosis results from thickened and hardened arterial walls. Arteriosclerotic blood vessels have lost much of their elasticity. &#10;&#10;Arrhythmias are irregular heartbeats. Remember, not all arrhythmias are evil.

      "answers": [" The origin   "],
      "explanation": "The origin is the end of the muscle that is attached to the portion of a bone that remains relatively motionless during movement. The other end of the muscle is attached to the portion of the bone that displays the greatest degree of movement. &#10;&#10;Synergistic movement is created by muscles that work together to bring about a particular movement. &#10;&#10;Antagonistic movement ensues from groups of muscles that work in an opposing manner to create the desired motion. For example, the bicep contracts while the tricep relaxes to allow the raising of the forelimb."

      "explanation": "Smooth muscle that lines the walls of blood vessels helps to regulate blood flow through the vessels via relaxation or constriction. Capillaries are extremely important for diffusion and exchange of gases. These vessel walls are very thin and therefore lack muscle so as to maximize diffusion. The velocity of blood flow decreases tremendously by the time that it reaches the capillaries, many of which possess lumens that are so small that red blood cells must pass through in single file."

      "explanation": "The atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH) is secreted by the atria in response to increased fluid volume signaled by atrial stretch. ANH causes the kidney to excrete greater quantities of sodium as well vasodilation of blood vessels, leading to a decrease in blood pressure. &#10;&#10;Calcitonin is released by the thyroid; it inhibits osteoclast activity in bones and absorption of calcium by the intestines, leading to diminished blood calcium levels. &#10;&#10;Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland in response to diminished light levels and causes the hypothalamus to ready the body for sleep. &#10;&#10;Erythropoietin is released by the kidneys and stimulates the production of red blood cells by the bone marrow."

They are considered the 'pacemaker' of the heart, as they produce the electrical impulses that generate the normal rhythm of the cardiac tissue. From the sinoatrial node, the route of depolarization of the heart then spreads across the atria to the atrioventricular node. The impulse is slightly delayed here until atrial contraction is completed. The wave of depolarization then quickly proceeds to the bundle of His, where it splits along the right and left bundle branches. The impulse eventually travels the length of these bundle branches along the path of the interventricular septum until it reaches the base of the heart, where the bundles divide into the Purkinje fiber system. The wave of depolarization is then distributed to the ventricular walls, causing contraction of the ventricles. &#10;&#10;Cardiology Explained. Euan, A.A., Niebauer, J. 2004. Remedica."

Most people when tapped between the eyes can inhibit themselves from blinking. Patients with Parkinson's cannot inhibit the facial reflex and will always blink, which is referred to as Myerson's sign. The facial reflex is as follows: tap proximal to orbit-> ophthalmic division or maxillary division of trigeminal (depends on the location of tapping)-> midbrain-> pons-> stimulation of orbicularis, inhibition of levator palpebrae superioris. &#10;&#10;The corneal reflex occurs when something touches the cornea and stimulates the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve which sends a signal to the post-central gyrus.

The complexes are recognized by virgin cytotoxic T cells and virgin helper T cells. The virgin cytotoxic T cells divide into effector T cells and memory T cells. The virgin T helper cells undergo differentiation into memory T cells and effector helper T cells. The memory T cells are stored for future encounters. The effector helper T cells promote mitosis of T and B cells to help combat the pathogens. Helper T cells do not kill any pathogens but help direct the immune system and the appropriate cells. Cytotoxic T cells are also known as killer T cells because upon contact with a target, they inject chemicals that cause death to the target cell. Virgin B cells, upon activation by effector helper T cells and interleukins, begin mitosis and differentiate into memory B cells and effector B cells. The new memory B cells are stored for future encounters. The effector B cells produce antibodies which serve to inactivate the offending agent."

      "options": [" Beta cells  ", " Alpha cells   ", " Kappa cells  ", " Delta cells  "],
      "answers": [" Alpha cells   "],
      "explanation": "Between meals, glucose levels drop. In order to maintain an adequate supply of glucose for muscles and other cells, glucagon (synthesized by alpha cells), causes the breakdown of glycogen. Beta cells of the pancreas produce insulin, which helps to shuttle glucose into tissues after a meal, thereby decreasing blood glucose levels. Delta cells of the pancreas secrete somatostatin. This hormone inhibits the secretion of glucagon, insulin, and the growth hormone. Kappa cells of the pancreas do not exist."

      "options": [" Bile pigments   ", " Shed blood cells  ", " Ingested food  ", " Hydrochloric acid  "],
      "answers": [" Bile pigments   "],
      "explanation": "Human feces typically displays a beautiful brown color due to the presence of bile pigments from the liver and gallbladder used in the digestion of fat. Although the food that we ingest can alter the color of fecal matter, it is generally colored brown. If blood is found in the stool it will change the color to black if the bleeding occurs in the stomach or small intestine or red if the bleeding results from rectal tears, hemorrhoids or other problems."

      "options": [" Bile secretion  ", " Secretion of hydrochloric acid  ", " Increased surface area   ", " Increased segmentation  "],
      "answers": [" Increased surface area   "],
      "explanation": "The lumen of the small intestine is lined with microvilli which are essentially digit-like extensions of the mucosa that serve to increase the surface area over which nutrients can be absorbed. Monosaccharides and amino acids are moved across the cellular membrane via active transport where they then enter into the bloodstream by facilitated diffusion. &#10;&#10;The intestines also employ a type of peristalsis called segmentation. Segmentation creates oscillatory movements via repeated relaxation and contraction of smooth muscles in the intestines helping to mix its contents and increase absorption. Segmentation is not carried out by microvilli but rather by smooth muscle. &#10;&#10;Bile is an important substance used in the breakdown of fat. It is produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder. &#10;&#10;Hydrochloric acid is secreted by cells in the stomach, not the microvilli; the acid serves to denature proteins, thus increasing their digestibility.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Small & Large Intestines"

      "explanation": "The first stage is a zygote in which the sperm and egg fuse together. The developing baby is then termed a morula. At this stage, multiple cleavages occur, forming a solid ball of cells. The next stage is the blastocyst, which is marked by the presence of a ball of cells possessing a surface layer along with an inner mass of cells. The embryonic stage is next, which encompasses all development from 2 weeks post-fertilization to the end of the 8th week. Lastly, the fetal stage occurs. The fetal stage lasts from the beginning of the ninth week of pregnancy until delivery, which is generally 39 weeks from fertilization."

      "options": [" Blood coagulation and formation of a blood clot  ", " The formation of a platelet plug  ", " Release of prothrombin  ", " Smooth muscle contraction in the wall of the blood vessel   "],
      "answers": [" Smooth muscle contraction in the wall of the blood vessel   "],
      "explanation": "Once a blood vessel becomes ruptured, the body's first response is hemostasis. This is a process by which blood flow is stopped or slowed to prevent blood loss by contracting the smooth muscle of the blood vessel (termed a spasm). Spasms serve to constrict the blood vessel in order to slow or stop blood flow from the injured vessel. Once a spasm is initiated, platelets begin to clump together and serve as a temporary plug in the vessel wall. Next, blood coagulates and forms a clot either via the intrinsic or extrinsic clotting mechanism. &#10;&#10;The intrinsic clotting mechanism involves the production of prothrombin which becomes converted to thrombin. Thrombin then acts on fibrinogen, causing the formation of fibrin which is essentially consists of long sticky strands that clump together. The fibrin creates a net that entangles red blood cells and platelets resulting in a blood clot. This mass of cells and platelets closes the wound. &#10;&#10;The extrinsic clotting mechanism occurs due to the receipt of signals from enzymes and other substances that do not reside in the blood which causes the clotting of blood. Blood clotting in this instance is triggered by injured vessels or tissues surrounding the damaged vessels. Aspirin interferes with the extrinsic pathway.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Blood-thinning Agents"

      "answers": [" Blue Sclera   "],
      "explanation": "Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a congenital, autosomal dominant condition that is characterized by brittle bones due to the production of abnormal type I collagen. There are four subtypes of OI, each with different severities and prognoses. Common symptoms include multiple bone fractures (due to brittle bones), potential hearing loss at an early age, and a blue hue to the sclera. Currently a cure does not exist for this condition; however, some drugs such as bisphosphonates and calcium supplements are delivering promising results. Therapies include caution with and minimization of dangerous or high-impact activities and practicing exercises geared towards building strong muscles and bones. Occasionally leg bones may need to be surgically reinforced with metal rods or braces. Some sources state that patients with OI are more likely to suffer from a retinal detachment due to poor scleral rigidity as well as the presence of subdural hematomas and retinal hemorrhages."

      "answers": [" FEV1 / FVC ratio is reduced   "],
      "explanation": "The ratio of FEV1 to FVC (forced expiratory volume over one second to forced vital capacity) is used in the diagnosis of obstructive and/or restrictive lung disease. This ratio indicates the amount of air that can be exhaled in one second in relation to the amount of total moveable air of the lungs. Studies have shown that normal individuals are able to exhale approximately 80% of their forced vital capacity in one second (and about 98% in 3 seconds). &#10;&#10;Patients with obstructive lung disease will typically show a decreased ratio (usually less than 70%) due to some obstruction of air escaping the lungs. On the contrary, patients with restrictive lung disease, the FEV1 and FVC are commonly equally reduced due to the presence of fibrosis or other lung pathology. Therefore, in these cases, the ratio tends to be approximately normal but may even be elevated as a result of increased FEV1 value relative to the FVC. &#10;&#10;Basic Skills in Interpreting Laboratory Data (4th edition).

      "explanation": "The alveoli are the sites of gas exchange within the lungs. The bronchi branch into bronchioles which terminate in alveoli. The lungs contain about 150 million of these small outpouchings. The alveoli are surrounded by pulmonary capillaries that enable rapid gas exchange. &#10;&#10;The lungs are surrounded by a pair of thin membranes called pleurae.

      "options": [" Calcium  ", " Troponin  ", " Adenosine triphosphate   ", " Carbon monoxide  "],
      "answers": [" Adenosine triphosphate   "],
      "explanation": "Upon contraction of a muscle, calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This is a type of modified endoplasmic reticulum that surrounds myofibrils and is responsible for calcium storage and release. Once the calcium is released, it binds to troponin, causing the binding site on the actin filament to become exposed. Actin is then free to bind to myosin, causing muscle contraction. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) initiates calcium uptake by the SR. In the absence of calcium, the binding site on the actin filament becomes blocked, allowing for muscle relaxation. &#10;&#10;When a person dies, ATP ceases to be formed. With the lack of ATP, the myosin cross-bridges cannot detach; this causes constant muscle contraction, or rigor mortis."

      "answers": [" Computed tomography exposes patients to ionizing radiation   "],
      "explanation": "Computed tomography (CT) imaging is widely available, relatively inexpensive, and generally quick and easy to perform when compared to other imaging techniques. Due to the instrumentation and faster testing time, claustrophobic patients and those with difficulty staying motionless tend to tolerate this test better. &#10;&#10;CT scans are typically indicated in conditions such as orbital trauma, bony involvement of tumors, detection of intraorbital calcification, and in cases of acute cerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhages. CT scans provide bone images of much greater detail than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Additionally, CT is also used in patients with contraindications to MRIs, such as the presence of metallic intraocular foreign bodies, cardiac pacemakers, and ferromagnetic aneurysm clips. &#10;&#10;However, unlike magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography does expose patients to ionizing radiation."

      "options": [" Carbon dioxide  ", " Uric acid   ", " Urea  ", " Ammonia  ", " Nitric acid  "],
      "answers": [" Uric acid   "],
      "explanation": "Uric acid is a waste product created when nucleic acids are broken down. If uric acid is not eliminated in the urine, it may accumulate and crystallize in joints, causing gout. Initially, patients who experience gout will often complain of pain in their big toe, knee, or ankle; these are the most common joints to be affected. &#10;&#10;Ammonia is formed during the process of deamination, wherein the amino groups are removed from amino acids that contain nitrogen. &#10;&#10;Protein metabolism results in the formation of urea in the liver; this is caused by the joining of two ammonia molecules with carbon dioxide. Some urea that is filtered by the kidneys is reabsorbed; the rest of it is eliminated in the urine. &#10;&#10;Kidney function is measured by evaluation of blood urea nitrogen. If these levels are found to be elevated, then the culprit is either depressed kidney function, body dehydration, heart failure, or a poor diet. &#10;&#10;The body rids itself of the waste product carbon dioxide via exhalation through the lungs."

      "answers": [" Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)   "],
      "explanation": "CEA is a biomarker for cancer, mainly colon cancer, but also lung cancer. It is not a screening test; rather, is used to follow people with a known disease. Central retinal vein thrombosis is usually due to hypercoagulability/hyperviscosity. When an elevated IgG or a distinctive spike is observed with IEP, myeloma or macroglobulinemia (which is much rarer) is suggested. Both of these conditions are associated with central retinal vein thrombosis. Diabetes is very common, and a blood glucose determination is appropriate. The most common cause of central retinal vein thrombosis is long-standing hypertension."

      "options": [" Cartilaginous joint  ", " Hinge-like joint  ", " Fibrous joint  ", " Synovial joint   "],
      "answers": [" Synovial joint   "],
      "explanation": "Joints are points of contact or near contact between bones. Synovial joints are the most common type. This joint type separates bones via a cavity, and the involved ends of the bones are covered with a layer of cartilage that helps to cushion the joint. Cells that line the capsules also secrete fluid called synovial fluid into the cavity of the joint. Ball-and-socket joints allow for a full range of movement. Hinge-like joints, like the knee and elbow, allow for movement in one plane. &#10;&#10;Cartilaginous joints are found between the vertebrae and some of the ribs. In this joint type, the space between the bones is filled with cartilage, which allows for little if any movement. &#10;&#10;Fibrous joints do not exhibit cavities. This joint type serves to unite bones and is found on the skull bones of a newborn baby."

      "answers": [" Axon hillock   "],
      "explanation": "In motor neurons and interneurons, the action potential is initiated at the axon hillock (which literally means 'little hill'). The axon hillock, also known as the trigger zone, is located at the junction between the cell body and the axon and possesses a much higher density of voltage-gated ion channels. &#10;&#10;The cell body of the axon contains the cellular nucleus and integrates input from its respective dendrites. &#10;&#10;The axon terminal is literally the end of the axon and is responsible for releasing neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. &#10;&#10;Dendrites receive input from other cells and typically extend from the cell body. Multipolar neurons have many dendrites, whereas bipolar neurons have only one dendrite and one axon. &#10;&#10;The nodes of Ranvier are the naked portions of the axon that are not enveloped in myelin sheath. It is here at the nodes where the action potential conduction occurs. Once an action potential is initiated, it spreads down the axon and actually jumps from node to node between the myelinated sections. It is via this manner that myelination increases the conduction speed of an action potential."

Homologous chromosomes are the same size and shape and contain genes that code for the same traits. Sister chromatids are duplicate threads of DNA and are linked by a centromere, creating a chromosome that resembles an 'X' (the centromere's location can vary, resulting in unequal legs of the X). A diploid cell contains two sets of each chromosome type (one from each of the parents) and is sometimes symbolized as '2n'. Human haploid cells (like the sperm and egg) contain 23 chromosomes."

      "answers": [" Gastrin   "],
      "explanation": "Gastrin is produced by G cells in the stomach lining and is released in response to amino acids and peptides in the stomach. Gastrin stimulates the secretion of gastric acid by parietal cells to promote digestion. Somatostatin is secreted in several different locations in the digestive tract: the stomach, intestine, and the pancreas. This hormone inhibits acid secretion. Secretin is produced by the small intestine and is secreted in response to the presence of acid in the duodenum. Once released, it promotes the secretion of bicarbonate by the pancreas to help maintain a specific pH range in the small intestine. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is secreted if fat is detected in the small intestine. CCK results in the enhancement of secretin, gallbladder contractions and promotes pancreatic enzyme secretion. Both secretin and CCK slow the rate of stomach emptying to enhance digestion in the small intestine."

Its primary function is to cushion the brain within the skull and act as a shock absorber for the central nervous system. Additionally, it aids in circulating nutrients and filtering waste products from the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid circulates from the lateral ventricles to the third ventricle through the interventricular foramen (foramina of Monro). From the third ventricle, CSF flows through the cerebral aqueduct (Sylvian aqueduct) to the fourth ventricle. It then passes through the foramina of Luschka and Magendie to enter the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain and spinal cord. CSF will then eventually return to the vascular system by entering the cerebral venous drainage system through the arachnoid villi."

Diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma is primarily made upon cytologic analysis, which will be positive for the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells. These cells are large binuclear or multinucleated cells with abundant pale cytoplasm that contains nuclei with reticulated chromatin and prominent macronucleoli. It is the Reed-Sternberg cells that induce the accumulation of benign inflammatory cells, leading to enlargement of the lymph nodes. In addition to Reed-Sternberg cells, patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma also possess Hodgkin's cells (large mononuclear cells with reticulated chromatin) and either one or two prominent nucleoli.

      "answers": [" Intrinsic factor   "],
      "explanation": "Intrinsic factor is secreted by the parietal cells that line the stomach. This glycoprotein is later used by the small intestine to help increase the absorption of vitamin B12. Hydrochloric acid is also secreted by cells in the stomach and serves to denature proteins, thereby increasing their digestive ability. Carboxypeptidase is secreted by the pancreas and passes into the small intestine to aid in the digestion of proteins. Food becomes broken down in the stomach and mixes with acid and enzymes to form a liquid called chyme which is then propelled into the small intestine for further breakdown."

      ],
      "answers": [" Nicotine stimulates the release of epinephrine which is a powerful vasoconstrictor  "],
      "explanation": "Nicotine causes the adrenal gland to release epinephrine which causes constriction of blood vessels and increases the heart rate, both of which can increase blood pressure. Carbon monoxide found in cigarette smoke displays a greater binding affinity to sites on hemoglobin than oxygen, forcing the heart to work harder to deliver oxygen to tissues. In addition to the above negative effects, carcinogens found in cigarette smoke may also play a role in plaque development. &#10;&#10;Myocarditis and endocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle and heart valves respectively, is generally caused by viral or bacterial infections. &#10;&#10;Nicotine use has been linked to an increase in low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and a decrease in high-density lipoproteins (HDLs). Remember, HDLs are the good form of cholesterol. Increased LDLs are related to atherosclerosis."

      "answers": [" Closing of the aortic and pulmonary valves   "],
      "explanation": "The primary sounds of the heart are caused by vibrations created by pressure differentials that occur during the closure of the heart valves. The opening of heart valves is typically very slow, occurring without an audible sound, while the rapid closure of the valves creates the 'lub-dub' sound that can be easily heard with a stethoscope. &#10;&#10;The first heart sound ('lub' or S1) arises from the closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves (also known as the atrioventricular valves). The mitral valve closes slightly earlier than the tricuspid valve because contraction of the ventricles begins with the left ventricle. &#10;&#10;The second heart sound ('dub' or S2) occurs as a result of the closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves (also known as the semilunar valves). The aortic valve closes just before the pulmonary valve due to the fact that the ejection of blood ends first in the left ventricle. &#10;&#10;Handbook of Cardiac Anatomy, Physiology, and Devices.

      "answers": [" Weight   ", " Length   "],
      "explanation": "The APGAR scoring system is a quick and accurate way of evaluating a baby's physical status directly after delivery. A physician or nurse will observe 5 signs and record a score for each on a scale of 0-2 based upon the degrees to which the sign is present (0-poor, 1-fair, 2-good). The 5 scores are then added together and range from 0-10. A score of 10 implies that the baby is in the best possible condition. A score of 8 or 9 indicates that the baby is in good condition, 4-7 indicates a fair condition, and 0-3 indicates a poor condition and the need for prompt diagnosis and treatment. The 5 signs are: &#10;&#10;1. Heart rate: 0-not detectable, 1-slow (less than 100), 2-Above 100 &#10;2. Respiratory effort: 0-absent, 1-slow, irregular, 2-good; crying &#10;3.

      "answers": [" Koplik's spots   "],
      "explanation": "Rubeola, also known as the red measles, is an infection seen in children between the ages of 5 and 15 caused by the paramyxovirus. This condition is extremely contagious causing a fever, blood-shot eyes, sore throat, and coughing followed by a maculopapular rash on the trunk, limbs, arms, face and neck. Koplik's spots occur on the buccal mucous membranes and appear as white-blue spots surrounded by red halos. The virus is self-limiting and treatment is palliative in nature. Conjunctivitis can occur with rubeola and is best managed via ocular lubricants, vasoconstrictor drops, and sunglasses if the patient is photosensitive. Topical antivirals are ineffective. Thankfully, a vaccination exists for rubeola that limits the outbreak incidence of this virus. &#10;&#10;Parotiditis is an infection or swelling of the salivary glands and is often seen with mumps. &#10;&#10;A maculopapular rash can be caused by a variety of viruses and is not a tell-tale sign of measles."

      "explanation": "Cushing's syndrome is a systemic condition that is caused by prolonged elevation of glucocorticoid levels in the bloodstream. The most common etiology of Cushing's syndrome is iatrogenically induced as a result of systemic administration of steroids. It may also be caused by hypersecretion of glucocorticoids by the adrenal glands or by hypersecretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by a pituitary adenoma. &#10;&#10;Addison's disease is a chronic endocrine disorder in which the adrenal glands do not produce a sufficient amount of steroid hormones. &#10;&#10;Conn's syndrome occurs secondary to an aldosterone-producing adenoma of the adrenal glands. &#10;&#10;Hashimoto's disease is an autoimmune condition in which the thyroid gland is affected, most commonly resulting in hypothyroidism, with occasional bouts of hyperthyroidism. &#10;&#10;Paget's disease is a chronic, progressive bone disease characterized by abnormal bone destruction and regrowth."

      "answers": [" Intravenous drug use   "],
      "explanation": "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), hepatitis C is most commonly spread to others by sharing needles or other equipment used in connection with intravenous drug use. Before the early 1990s (when widespread blood screening began), hepatitis C was also commonly transmitted through organ transplants and blood transfusions. Other, more common routes of infection include needle-stick injuries in healthcare settings and transmission of infection from mothers to children at birth. Less commonly, a person may also become infected with hepatitis C by sharing personal items that may have come into contact with another person's blood (such as toothbrushes or razors), or by having sexual contact with an infected individual. &#10;&#10;Hepatitis A is typically spread when the virus is taken in by mouth from objects that have been contaminated with fecal matter from an infected person. This may occur due to improper hygiene during food preparation, caregivers not washing hands after changing diapers, or certain sexual activities with infected individuals. Hepatitis A may also be contracted by eating or drinking contaminated food or water, although this avenue of infection tends to occur more often in countries other than the United States where hepatitis A is common and sanitary conditions are poor. The foods and drinks most likely to be contaminated with this virus are fruits, vegetables, shellfish, ice, and water. &#10;&#10;Infection with the hepatitis B virus occurs when blood, semen, or other bodily fluids of an infected person enter the body of another. Activities that can lead to spread of the virus include exposure from needle-sticks, direct contact with blood or open sores, sharing items such as razors or toothbrushes, sharing needles or other drug-injection equipment, sexual contact, and transmission to children during birth."

      "answers": [" Grave's disease   "],
      "explanation": "Grave's disease is a specific, immunologic cause of hyperthyroidism. Inflammatory cells can proliferate in the back of the eye, filling the orbit and forcing the globe forward (exophthalmos). It can also infiltrate the extra-ocular muscles causing muscle thickening and restriction of movement, leading to double vision. Hodgkin's disease is a specific form of lymphoma which could theoretically infiltrate the orbit and produce exophthalmos, although this is much less likely and would be seen late in the course of the disease. Cushing's disease (hyperadrenocorticism) is an excess of cortisone; Addison's disease (hypoadrenocorticism) is an insufficiency in cortisone. Neither Cushing's nor Addison's are associated with exophthalmos."

      "answers": [" Decrease in intraocular pressure   ", " Decrease in corneal sensitivity   "],
      "explanation": "In addition to changes in corneal thickness that occur during pregnancy, other anterior segment findings also commonly appear during this time. These observations include a decrease in corneal sensitivity, which typically returns to normal by eight weeks postpartum. A decrease in intraocular pressure has also been observed during the second half of pregnancy. This finding may also persist for several months after giving birth. The reduction in IOP is likely caused by an increase in the outflow facility of aqueous as a result of a combination of several factors, including an increase in uveoscleral outflow (due to hormonal changes), decreased episcleral venous pressure, and a decrease in the overall pressure in the upper extremities. For these reasons, there have been cases of pre-existing glaucoma that have actually improved during pregnancy. &#10;&#10;Reduced tear production resulting from a disruption of lacrimal acinar cells commonly causes an increase in the possibility of dry eyes, infection, and contact lens intolerance. Some studies have also reported a development of Krukenberg spindles in pregnant women. This observation is not typically associated with other commonly seen findings in pigment dispersion, and the presence usually decreases during the third trimester and postpartum. The development of eyelid ptosis and other ocular motility defects have also been reported both during and after normal pregnancies; this is commonly related to fluid retention and hormonal changes."

      "answers": [" Nodes of Ranvier   "],
      "explanation": "The nodes of Ranvier are the naked portions of the axon that are not enveloped in myelin sheath. It is here at the nodes where the action potential conduction occurs. Once an action potential is initiated, it spreads down the axon and actually jumps from node to node between the myelinated sections. The nodes contain high numbers of voltage-gated sodium channels. It is via this manner that myelination increases the conduction speed of an action potential. &#10;&#10;The axon terminal is literally the end of the axon and is responsible for releasing neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. The cleft is a gap between the post- and pre- synaptic cells. &#10;&#10;Dendrites receive input from other cells and typically extend from the cell body.

      "answers": [" Cartilage   "],
      "explanation": "Cartilage is a type of flexible, specialized connective tissue that serves to cushion and helps to maintain the shape of certain body parts. Cartilage is avascular and as such, if injured, takes a very long time to heal. &#10;&#10;Bone connective tissue forms the weight-bearing tissue of the skeleton. This tissue type differs from other connective tissue in that its matrix is hardened and is abundant in calcium. &#10;&#10;Adipose tissue is important for fat storage. Fat is used as an energy source as well as a shock absorber. Common fat storage sites are above the kidneys, behind the eyes, under the skin as isolation, hips, abdomen and thighs. How much and where the fat accumulates is determined by genetics. Diet and exercise also serve to regulate the quantity of fat that is deposited. &#10;&#10;Dense, regular connective tissue is composed of parallel bundles of fibers which rows of fibroblasts located between them. Because they fibers are oriented in this manner, they are quite resistant to pulling forces along their axis of orientation and thus are ideal for supporting other organs and supplying elasticity. This type of connective tissue is generally found in tendons and skin."

      "answers": [" Thymus gland abnormalities   "],
      "explanation": "Approximately 75% of patients diagnosed with myasthenia gravis have concurrent thymus gland abnormalities; of these patients, 85% show hyperplasia or germinal center formation. Encapsulated tumors or thymomas occur in the remaining 10-30% of these patients. In patients diagnosed with ocular myasthenia only, the overall risk of thymoma is reduced to approximately 4%. Due to the relationship between the occurrence of myasthenia gravis and thymus gland abnormalities, it is thought that the thymus may play a significant role in the autoimmune response seen in this condition. In addition to thymus gland abnormalities, patients with myasthenia gravis also tend to have an association with hyper and/or hypothyroidism (3-15%), rheumatoid arthritis (5%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (2%).&#10;PowerPage&#10;Myasthenia Gravis"

      "answers": [" Diminished deep tendon reflexes   "],
      "explanation": "Holmes-Adie's syndrome is a condition that involves pupillary signs (enlarged pupil with poor response to light), loss of deep tendon reflexes, and abnormalities of sweating. Other associated signs may include photophobia, hyperopia due to accommodative paresis, and difficulty reading. These ocular signs and symptoms occur as a result of inflammation and damage of post-ganglionic parasympathetic pupillary fibers that course from the ciliary ganglion to the pupil sphincter. Systemic associations are thought to be caused by damage to the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord. Although the underlying etiology is not fully understood, most investigators believe that Adie's syndrome occurs following a viral or bacterial infection that leads to damage to the nerve fibers."

      "answers": [" Duchenne muscular dystrophy   "],
      "explanation": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) affects most of the muscles of the human body due to an x-linked genetic mutation of the dystrophin gene. DMD is characterized by the progressive weakness and necrosis of striated muscle, with the exception of the extraocular muscles, which appear to be clinically unaffected. Although the etiology behind this exclusion is controversial, it is believed that the extraocular muscles have a better intrinsic ability to maintain calcium homeostasis as compared to other groups of striated muscle. &#10;&#10;Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Grave's ophthalmopathy, myasthenia gravis, and myotonic dystrophy (both types 1 and 2) are all conditions in which the extraocular muscles are either preferentially or exclusively involved. &#10;&#10;Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: Advances in Therapeutics.

      "question": "The reversible replacement of one differentiated cell type with another mature differentiated cell type (as seen in patients with Barrett's esophagus) is known as which of the following?",
      "options": [" Dysplasia  ", " Neoplasia  ", " Anaplasia  ", " Metaplasia   ", " Hyperplasia  "],
      "answers": [" Metaplasia   "],
      "explanation": "Metaplasia refers to the reversible substitution of one differentiated cell type for another fully differentiated cell type within a given tissue. Metaplasia most commonly occurs in epithelial tissues and can be part of the normal maturation process or can be a result of some abnormal stimulus. This occurs in cases of Barrett's esophagus, thought to be the result of cellular damage from chronic stomach acid exposure. The original cells lining the lower esophagus are not robust enough to withstand this harsh environment and change into a cell type that is better suited for the environment. &#10;&#10;Dysplasia refers to a disorderly arrangement of cells due to an alteration of size, shape, and organization of cells within a tissue. Also, it usually affects epithelial tissues and is typically reversible. Dysplasia generally consists of an expansion of immature cells and a decrease in number and location of mature cells. An example of this type of growth is evident in epithelial dysplasia of the cervix (commonly identified on a pap smear), in which there is an increased population of immature basal-like cells of the mucosal surface that have not invaded through the basement membrane to the deeper soft tissues. &#10;&#10;Anaplasia refers to an alteration of differentiation. Anaplastic cells are usually poorly differentiated or undifferentiated. These types of cells divide rapidly but do not resemble normal cells structurally or functionally. &#10;&#10;Hyperplasia is an increase in the number of cells in a tissue. It may eventually result in the gross enlargement of a tissue or organ. One example of this type of cell growth is benign prostatic hyperplasia in which there is enlargement of the prostate in males. &#10;&#10;Neoplasia refers to a new growth composed of cells that were originally derived from normal tissue but have undergone a change that results in them becoming unresponsive to normal growth controls; this creates a tumor. Prior to neoplastic growth, cells often undergo another abnormal pattern of growth, such as metaplasia or dysplasia. &#10;&#10;Fundamentals of Toxicologic Pathology (2nd edition).

      "options": [" Eccrine  ", " Holocrine  ", " Endocrine  ", " Merocrine   ", " Apocrine  "],
      "answers": [" Merocrine   "],
      "explanation": "Merocrine glands are a type of exocrine gland in which secretion of the substance occurs as a result of exocytosis without any loss of the original cellular components. The pancreas and sweat glands of the body are examples of merocrine glands. &#10;&#10;Holocrine glands excrete their substances via rupturing of their plasma membranes; the cell is also destroyed during this process. Therefore, the cells themselves become part of the excretory product that accumulates in the gland. Sebaceous glands of the skin and meibomian glands of the eyelids are considered holocrine glands. &#10;&#10;Apocrine glands discharge part of the cell in order to release the secretory substance. It is less damaging to the original cell than holocrine but more damaging than merocrine. An example of this type of gland is the mammary gland. &#10;&#10;DiFiore's Atlas of Histology with Functional Correlations (12th edition). Eroschenko, V.P., DiFiore, M.S.H. 2013.

      "answers": [" Pre-eclampsia   "],
      "explanation": "Pre-eclampsia is a combination of several classic factors that occur during pregnancy, including high blood pressure, fluid retention, and high levels of protein in the urine. This condition typically occurs in women after their 20th week of pregnancy and usually affects about 1 in 20 women. Some women may be asymptomatic; however, most patients experience symptoms of a reduction in the amount of urine produced, swelling of the face, hands, and feet, and/or sudden or excessive weight gain over a period of a couple of days. In addition, blood pressure is commonly elevated to levels above 140/90. &#10;&#10;Pre-eclampsia is a dangerous condition, and if not properly treated, it can progress to eclampsia, which is a potentially fatal condition that involves seizures and comas. It is unclear as to the cause of pre-eclampsia, but certain women have been shown to posses a higher risk (first pregnancy, women over 40, African-American women, women who have already suffered from pre-eclampsia, and women who have a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney disease). Treatment typically involves bed rest, drinking a lot of water, and close monitoring of blood pressure. In some cases, inducing labor early may be necessary."

      "options": [" Edward syndrome  ", " Turner syndrome   ", " Down syndrome  ", " Klinefelter syndrome  "],
      "answers": [" Turner syndrome   "],
      "explanation": "Turner syndrome is a chromosomal disorder in which all or part of one of the sex chromosomes is missing or abnormal. It typically occurs in about 1 in 2,000 live female births (this number varies slightly according to literature). &#10;&#10;Edward syndrome is a genetic chromosomal disorder cause by the presence of either all or a portion of an extra 18th chromosome (also known as trisomy 18). It occurs in about 1 in 6,000 births. &#10;&#10;Klinefelter syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality that results from additional genetic material on the X chromosome in males (also known as XXY). It exists in roughly 1 in 500 and 1 in 1000 live male births, but many of these males do not show symptoms. If the physical characteristics inherent in this abnormality have not become apparent earlier, they typically appear after the onset of puberty. &#10;&#10;Down syndrome is considered as the most prevalent chromosomal disorder and is the most frequently recognizable cause of mental or intellectual disability. It is caused by extra genetic material on chromosome 21 (also known as trisomy 21). Down syndrome occurs once in about every 700 births, is seen in all ethnic groups, and has a slight predilection for males over females, although this predilection is very small. &#10;&#10;Down Syndrome: The Facts (3rd edition).

      "answers": [" Chest X-ray (CXR) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level   "],
      "explanation": "Sarcoid is a multi-system disease involving the eyes, skin, heart, and primarily the lungs. It is much more frequently found in African-Americans. There also appears to be an association with Scandinavian origins. &#10;&#10;Each of the answers has some element of applicability, but a chest x-ray with hilar adenopathy and an elevation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme is diagnostic. A back x-ray and HLAb27 are associated with uveitis, particularly the HLAb27. There is cardiac involvement in sarcoid so an EKG is appropriate but not diagnostic. CRP is a nonspecific measure of inflammation. Patients often suffer from shortness of breath and a spirometry is appropriate to assess breathing, but again, it is not diagnostic. Alpha I antitrypsin deficiency is associated with premature emphysema but is not specific for sarcoid."

      "answers": [" Diminished corneal sensitivity   "],
      "explanation": "An acoustic neuroma is a benign intracranial tumor involving the myelin-forming Schwann cells of the vestibulocochlear (8th) cranial nerve. These tumors are typically very slow growing over the period of several years and may not exhibit any obvious symptoms in early stages. Eventually, when symptoms become apparent, these will include ipsilateral sensorineural hearing loss (most common), diminished sense of balance, vertigo, a feeling of pressure in the ear, and tinnitus. &#10;&#10;As the tumor grows, it may lead to compression of the adjacent areas of the brainstem, resulting in involvement of other nearby cranial nerves. The most commonly affected is the trigeminal nerve (5th cranial nerve), causing diminished corneal sensitivity. Due to its location, the sixth cranial nerve may become involved, and very large tumors can result in elevated intracranial pressure; however, these signs are much less commonly observed."

      ],
      "answers": [" Endocrine glands secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream   ", " Endocrine glands are also known as ductless glands   "],
      "explanation": "Glands of the human body can be categorized into two major groups, endocrine glands and exocrine glands. An endocrine gland secretes chemical regulators (hormones) directly into the bloodstream to act on tissues near the release site, while an exocrine gland secretes its products into ducts in order to reach some other environment external to itself (whether it be on the surface of or inside the body). Therefore, endocrine glands do not have ducts, while exocrine glands do. &#10;&#10;Exocrine gland types can be further classified by their method of excretion. Merocrine glands excrete their substances by exocytosis. Apocrine glands have a portion of their plasma membrane that buds off of the cell, containing the substance to be excreted. Holocrine glands excrete their substances via rupturing of their plasma membranes; the cell is also destroyed during this process. &#10;&#10;Examples of endocrine glands include the pituitary, thyroid, hypothyroid, etc. &#10;&#10;Sebaceous glands of the skin and meibomian glands of the eyelids are considered holocrine exocrine glands. &#10;&#10;Barron's Anatomy and Physiology: The Easy Way (2nd edition).

      "explanation": "Patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of giant cell arteritis (GCA) should immediately undergo erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) testing. Although there are no positively definitive studies on the range of ESR in normal patients, there is a formula that allows an estimation of the normal maximum ESR, which is dependent on gender and age. &#10;&#10;- For females, the maximum ESR can be calculated by adding 10 to the patient's age and then dividing that number by two: (age+10)/2 &#10;- For males, the maximum ESR is equivalent to the patient's age divided by two: age/2 &#10;&#10;If ESR testing is normal in patients exhibiting symptoms of GCA, these patients should still undergo a temporal artery biopsy due to the fact that 8-22% of patients with biopsy-proven GCA will show a normal ESR.

      "question": "Grave's disease is an autoimmune disease affecting the thyroid and resulting in over-activity or hyperthyroidism. It is also associated with multiple ocular manifestations. Which 3 of the following findings are expected in a patient with Grave's disease? (Select 3)",
      "options": [" Exophthalmos   ", " Retinal detachment  ", " Endophthalmitis  ", " A thyroid stare   ", " Risk of corneal exposure   ", " Keratoconus  ", " Rubeosis iridis  "],
      "answers": [" Exophthalmos   ", " A thyroid stare   ", " Risk of corneal exposure   "],
      "explanation": "The ocular manifestations of Grave's disease include unilateral and bilateral exophthalmos, which is usually secondary to inflammatory materials being deposited behind the eye. The sympathetic stimulation causes the upper lid to retract therefore leading it to lag when looking downward or to create the appearance of a stare even in the absence of significant exophthalmos. The condition of exophthalmos often makes it difficult to close the eye at night, making patching and taping necessary in some cases to prevent exposure of the cornea and consequential corneal ulcerations."

      "question": "A 13 year-old patient is seen at your office reporting headaches for the past 2 months. She reports that the headaches are dull and occur above her eyes. The headaches are typically not present upon wakening and worsen towards mid-day, especially with reading. She typically does not experience any headaches on the weekend unless she is using the computer or reading. Based upon the patient's case history alone, what is the MOST likely etiology of her headaches?",
      "options": [" Eyestrain   ", " Tension  ", " Migraine  ", " Sinusitis  "],
      "answers": [" Eyestrain   "],
      "explanation": "Ocular-related headaches or those due to eyestrain present with prolonged use of the eyes. The majority of patients will note an absence of headache in the morning (although some will report headaches in the morning due to excessive ocular use the night before). The headaches are typically dull in nature and occur around or above the eyes. Occasionally, the eyestrain can occur concurrently with a tension headache, and the patient may also report tightness of the neck or pain in the occipital region. &#10;&#10;Tension headaches, also known as muscular contraction headaches, are most commonly caused by stress and may be also be attributed to poor posture, hunger and fatigue. This type of headache is associated with stiffness of the muscles in the neck region and pain around the occipital region or a vice-like pain in the frontal area. Patients typically report the presence of a throbbing pain. &#10;&#10;Migraine headaches are thought to be neurological in nature and can be triggered by several mechanisms such as hormonal changes or neurotransmitter imbalances. Typically patients will note a unilateral throbbing/pulsating pain. Patients will generally experience associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. Some patients will perceive an aura immediately preceding the headache. &#10;&#10;Sinus headaches are more commonly 'associated acute' rather than 'chronic nasal sinusitis' and usually present with a deep and constant pain in the frontal region of the head. Pain in these cases is usually associated with other sinus symptoms such as rhinorrhea, feeling of fullness in the ears, fever, facial swelling, and lacrimation. Patients typically report a transient loss of the sense of smell. The majority of patients will note an increase in pain/pressure when bending down. &#10;&#10;Primary Care Optometry 5th edition.

      "explanation": "Specific immunity indicates a response that is specific to the offending agent and requires recognition of that agent by the immune system. Regular epithelial cell turnover and properties of the tears are both examples of non-specific immunity. Interferon production is also a non-specific response. T- lymphocytes are not capable of secreting antibodies; this is a role of B- lymphocytes. The activation of cytotoxic T- lympocytes (CTL) to recognize and remove virally infected cells is a role of the specific immune system. Other examples of specific immune functions include production of specific antibodies by B- lymphocytes and plasma cells after activation by an antigen."

      "explanation": "The foramen magnum lies at the base of the occipital lobe and serves as the opening for the spinal cord. Foramen magnum literally means 'great hole'. The foramen ovale courses through the posterior portion of the sphenoid bone; the opening serves as a passageway for several nerves including the mandibular nerve. The foramen rotundum allows the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve to pass through the sphenoid bone and the pterygopalatine fossa. The foramen spinosum is located on the greater wing of the sphenoid bone and basically transmits the middle meningeal artery.

      "answers": [" Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)   "],
      "explanation": "Patients with hyperthyroidism will have low levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and elevated levels of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) present in the bloodstream. These principles are the basis for laboratory tests used to diagnose an underactive or overactive thyroid gland. &#10;&#10;In cases of hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland is producing an excessive amount of the thyroid hormones (both free and total). The pituitary gland then senses that there is too much circulating thyroid hormones, and in turn shuts down production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in order to subsequently cause the thyroid to slow down its production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine (T3 and T4). Therefore, a decline in TSH is an attempt by the pituitary gland to return the circulating thyroid hormones to normal levels. On the other hand, in hypothyroidism, the thyroid gland is not producing an adequate amount of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), so the pituitary gland will produce more TSH in order to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more hormones. Consequently, patients with hypothyroidism will show low levels of T3 and T4 and elevated TSH values."

      "answers": [" Lactotrophic adenoma   "],
      "explanation": "Lactotrophic adenomas are also known as prolactinomas, and are prolactin-secreting tumors of the pituitary gland. Prolactinomas are the most common secretory pituitary tumor; they account for about 40% of all pituitary adenomas. In addition to increasing the secretion of prolactin, prolactinomas may also secrete other hormones, most commonly growth hormone. Symptoms of a prolactinoma vary based on the size of the tumor but can include galactorrhea and hypogonadism (as a result of increased prolactin in the blood), as well as headache and visual field defects (due to mass effect from an expanding tumor). &#10;&#10;It is also important to note that about 25% of pituitary adenomas are non-secretory. &#10;&#10;The Washington Manual Subspecialty Consult Series: Endocrinology Subspecialty Consult (Third edition).

      "answers": [" Hair cells in the organ of Corti   "],
      "explanation": "Sound is funneled by the pinna (the outer ear) into the auditory canal to the tympanic membrane. Vibration of this membrane transfers the sound energy to the malleus (or the hammer), which then passes it to the incus (anvil) and on to the stapes (stirrup). The energy is transmitted to the oval window, which is considerably smaller than the tympanic membrane, causing amplification of the original sound vibrations. The oval window conveys the sound to the cochlea, a fluid-filled, snail-shaped apparatus consisting of the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani; these surround the central cochlear duct. It is within the cochlear duct that the magic happens. The floor of the cochlear duct houses the basilar membrane, which serves as a bed for the organ of Corti. Hair cells of the organ of Corti protrude upwards onto a membrane called the tectorial membrane. Sound waves cause the fluid in the cochlea to move, vibrating the basilar membrane. This vibration in turn pushes the hair cells against the tectorial membrane, causing the hair cells to bend. The bent hair cells release neurotransmitters, resulting in action potentials of the auditory nerve. Pressure waves travel through the cochlea and are released to the round window, which helps to release some of the pressure caused by the force of the sound waves. &#10;&#10;Remember: physiologically, the oval window transmits the sound waves before the round window."

      "options": [" Herpes simplex  ", " Syphilis   ", " Gonorrhea  ", " Chlamydia  ", " Human immunodeficiency virus  "],
      "answers": [" Syphilis   "],
      "explanation": "Primary syphilis infections typically occur after a 2-4 week incubation period and are characterized by the development of a chancre at the site of infection. A chancre is a painless ulcer that is most commonly found on the penis in males and vulva in females. The presence of a chancre is also associated with enlargement of the inguinal lymph nodes that are present in the groin area. If left untreated, these skin lesions will typically resolve within a period of 2-6 weeks, leaving an atrophic scar in the region."

      "question": "A patient presents to your office with decreased vision of the right eye. Dilated fundus exam shows midperipheral retinal hemorrhages in the right eye and a clear and healthy fundus in the left eye. In addition, you note iris neovascularization to be present on slit lamp evaluation. What test should be ordered next for this patient?",
      "options": [" Humphrey visual fields  ", " Optical coherence tomography  ", " Amsler grid  ", " Heidelberg Retina Tomography  ", " Carotid Doppler   "],
      "answers": [" Carotid Doppler   "],
      "explanation": "Unilateral, midperipheral hemorrhages are characteristic of Ocular Ischemic Syndrome (OIS). OIS is typically a result of carotid disease where 90% or more of the ipsilateral carotid artery is blocked. This limits blood flow to the eye resulting in signs such as midperipheral hemorrhages, iris neovascularization, and posterior segment neovascularization. More than 50% of patients with OIS will also manifest iris neovascularization. &#10;&#10;A carotid Doppler is indicated in these patients in order to evaluate the extent of the carotid artery occlusion and to determine if a carotid endarterectomy is needed. There is a sense of urgency for care in these patients because of the possibility of a stroke. Additionally, the prognosis is generally poor with a 40% mortality rate within 5 years."

      "options": [" Hydrogen  ", " Nitrogen   ", " Carbon dioxide  ", " Oxygen  "],
      "answers": [" Nitrogen   "],
      "explanation": "Underwater, the greater the depth, the greater the increase in pressure; therefore, many divers must breathe pressurized air to increase the pressure of the gas in their lungs. However, as the divers begin their return to the surface, the pressure of the water decreases; this can cause nitrogen to rapidly exit from the tissues into the bloodstream. Rapid ascents do not allow divers to exhale the excess nitrogen quickly enough, leading to the formation of nitrogen bubbles, which can block blood flow to their brain tissues."

      "answers": [" Hyperpolarizing   "],
      "explanation": "Many neurons receive input from multiple other neurons. Some of the input is excitatory in nature, termed excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), and others are inhibitory (IPSPs). Inhibitory signals push the membrane of the neuron away from its threshold point and therefore cause hyperpolarization because the inside of the membrane becomes even more negatively charged. When excitatory potentials cause the membrane of the neuron to become more positively charged relative to its resting state, they are hypopolarizing. All of the synaptic signals that reach the input zone at the same time are integrated together. If the resulting message causes the membrane to reach its threshold, an action potential ensues."

      "answers": [" IgE antibodies   "],
      "explanation": "A type I hypersensitive reaction (a.k.a., anaphylactic, immediate, or IgE-mediated) results when the offending antigen causes production of IgE antibodies, which then attach to mast cells. Subsequent exposure to the antigen causes degranulation of mast cells, resulting in release of histamine, leukotrienes, serotonin, and other allergy and inflammatory mediators. &#10;&#10;IgM is the antibody responsible for activation of the complement pathway and is the first antibody produced in response to an infection. &#10;&#10;IgA antibodies are known as the secretory antibodies and are located in mucous membranes.

In this type of muscle movement, circular muscle contracts behind the food while the muscles in front of it relax to allow for passage. &#10;&#10;The intestines also employ a type of peristalsis called segmentation. Segmentation creates oscillatory movements via repeated relaxation and contraction of smooth muscles in the intestines helping to mix its contents and increase absorption. &#10;&#10;Isometric contraction occurs when a muscle is contracting but is not shortening. This type of muscle tension is used for load-bearing situations such as holding a plate of food in front of oneself. &#10;&#10;When the eyes are fixated upon a moving object, the resulting movement is called a smooth pursuit."

Vasodilation occurs when the smooth muscle that lines the blood vessels relaxes. Histamine also promotes increased capillary permeability, causing the vessels to leak water and solutes, which produces localized edema. &#10;&#10;Nociceptors are pain receptors and are not inhibited by histamine release."

        " It will generate an action potential of greater magnitude  ",
        " It will generate an action potential equal to the first   ",

      "explanation": "Action potentials fire based upon an all-or-none principle. That is, once threshold is reached, an action potential will ensue, and its signal will not decay along the length of the axon. The magnitude and length of the action potential is always the same, regardless of the strength of the stimulus. However, in order to code for the strength of the stimulus, more action potentials will be generated with increased frequencies, which in turn determines the amount of neurotransmitter released by the pre-synaptic terminals. &#10;&#10;Ref: Kandel, E, Schwartz, H and Jessell T.

      "question": "A red blood cell is placed into a solution of 100% distilled water. What will happen to the red blood cell?",
      "options": [" It will remain unchanged  ", " Crenation  ", " It will swell   ", " It will shrink  "],
      "answers": [" It will swell   "],
      "explanation": "The cell will swell because the replacement surrounding solution (distilled water) is hypotonic to the cell. Because the cell contains a higher concentration of solutes, water will diffuse into the cell in an attempt to equalize the solute concentration. If a red blood cell is placed into a solution that contains a higher concentration of solutes than the cell (that is, the solution is hypertonic to the cell) water will rush out of the cell due to osmosis and the cell will shrink and become crenated. If both the cell and the surrounding medium contain equal concentrations of solute then the two are said to be isotonic, and water will not leave or enter the cell."

      "answers": [" Junctional nevi   "],
      "explanation": "Junctional nevi are composed of nevus cells that are located at the junction between the epidermis and dermis. They are usually flat and brown or black in color. &#10;&#10;Compound nevi are comprised of nevus cells that extend from the epidermis into the dermis layers of the skin (mixture of junctional and intradermal proliferation). They are usually slightly raised and the shade of pigment varies from tan to dark brown. &#10;&#10;Intradermal nevi are the most common form of an acquired nevus. The nevus cells are completely confined to the dermis. This type of nevi is typically raised, and most are flesh-colored (not pigmented). &#10;&#10;Blue nevi are composed of spindle-shaped nevus cells that are located deep within the layers of the dermis. The covering epidermis is normal, leading to a bluish-colored lesion. &#10;&#10;Spitz nevi are a variant of an intradermal nevus that commonly presents as a raised, reddish lesion."

      "answers": [" Basal cell carcinoma   "],
      "explanation": "Basal cell carcinoma is that most common human malignancy. About 90% of all cases present on the head and neck, with 10% of those involving the eyelid. Basal cell carcinoma is also the most prevalent malignant eyelid tumor, accounting for close to 90% of all cases. Most occur in the lower eyelid, followed by the medial canthus, upper eyelid, and lateral canthus. &#10;&#10;Squamous cell carcinoma is much less common than basal cell carcinoma, but it is potentially more aggressive due to a higher risk of regional lymph node metastasis. &#10;&#10;Sebaceous gland carcinoma is a very rare tumor that typically arises from the meibomian glands. Malignant melanomas rarely occur on the eyelids but are potentially lethal; Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular tumor that most commonly affects patients infected with AIDS."

      "answers": [" Kearns-Sayre syndrome   "],
      "explanation": "Kearns-Sayre syndrome is considered a mitochondrial myopathy in which mitochondrial DNA deletions result in a clinical triad of signs. These signs include ocular features such as progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) and 'salt and pepper' pigmented retinopathy (with predilection for the macula), as well as one or more systemic complications, which can include heart block, cerebellar ataxia, or abnormally elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein. &#10;&#10;Grave's ophthalmopathy occurs as a result of an autoimmune disease that results in thickening of the extraocular muscles. &#10;&#10;Ocular myasthenia gravis is also an autoimmune disease that causes weakness of the extraocular muscles and levator palpebrae superioris. &#10;&#10;Myotonic dystrophy is caused by mutations of the DMPK gene (type 1) and CNBP gene (type 2). Extraocular muscle symptoms of this type of disease include rebound nystagmus, saccadic dysfunctions, and optokinetic nystagmus. &#10;&#10;Electrodiagnosis of Retinal Diseases. Miyake, Y. 2006.

The sublingual glands are found beneath the tongue and the submandibular glands are nestled in the lower jaw in the floor of the mouth. By secreting saliva, these glands aid in the initial stages of digestion. &#10;&#10;The lacrimal glands secrete the aqueous portion of the tears. &#10;&#10;The pterygoid plexus is a collection of veins that drain from the pterygoid muscles into the facial vein. &#10;&#10;Apocrine glands are sweat glands and are thus implicated in body temperature regulation."

      "options": [" Lactoferrin  ", " Erythropoiesis  ", " Eryptosis  ", " Erythropoietin   "],
      "answers": [" Erythropoietin   "],
      "explanation": "Erythropoietin is released by the kidneys in order to simulate red blood cell production by stem cells in red bone marrow. On average three million red blood cells are introduced into the blood stream each second. Red blood cells have an average lifespan of 120 days. As they mature, they lose their nucleus as well as other organelles. When an erythrocyte nears the end of its life cycle, it undergoes a change to its plasma membrane, making it easy for macrophages to recognize and engulf it. Once it has been phagocytized, the amino acids are returned to the blood stream and the heme groups can be recycled in the red bone marrow. Unusable heme groups are converted to bilirubin and make their way to the liver where they become mixed with bile. &#10;&#10;Erythropoesis is the actual process in which new red blood cells are produced. &#10;&#10;Eryptosis is basically programmed red blood cell death. &#10;&#10;Lactoferrin is a glycoprotein found in milk, tears and saliva.

      "answers": [" All of the above   "],
      "explanation": "Hyperpigmentation of the inferior periorbital skin are commonly called allergic shiners. This is due to engorgement of superficial capillaries due to downstream vascular congestion from inflammation of the nasal mucosa. The lateral crease of the distal nose occurs (commonly called a nasal crease) due to frequent rubbing of the nose as a result of nasal pruritus. Finally, lymphoproliferation of the posterior oropharynx ('cobblestoning') is due to the chronic inflammatory response that is the basis of allergic rhinitis."

      "options": [" Lateral wall  ", " Medial wall  ", " Floor   ", " Roof  "],
      "answers": [" Floor   "],
      "explanation": "All of the walls of the orbit are relatively thin, making them susceptible to injury and fracture when blunt force trauma to the eye is incurred. Increased pressure in the orbit often results in one or more areas of the orbit to break and 'blow out' into the sinuses. The inferior and medial walls tend to be the most susceptible to this type of injury, although an orbital floor fracture is the most common. In certain patients, a blowout fracture of the floor will require surgical repair. These circumstances include cases in which there is rectus muscle entrapment, enophthalmus greater than 2mm, and large fractures that include over 50% of the involved wall (this is typically decided after a 2-week waiting period)."

      "question": "Which 3 of the following are thought to be risk factors for Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? (Select 3)",
      "options": [" Low birth weight   ", " Frequent childhood infections   ", " Decreased angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels  ", " Overexposure to lead  ", " An alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency   ", " An increased production of surfactant  "],
      "answers": [" Low birth weight   ", " Frequent childhood infections   ", " An alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency   "],
      "explanation": "COPD is an irreversible, progressive narrowing of the airways which eventually leads to fibrosis and destruction of alveolar tissue. Symptoms include a cough (with or without sputum), shortness of breath that worsens with activity, wheezing, fatigue and/or difficulty catching one's breath. The biggest risk factor is smoking cigarettes. Other risk factors include: a low birth weight, age, a dusty work environment, decreased levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin levels, damp housing quarters, a diet that is low in fish, fruits and antioxidants, frequent childhood infections, and exposure to environmental pollution. It is also purported that a history of atopy and a hyper-responsive airway (the Dutch hypothesis), as well as persistent bronchopulmonary infections (the British hypothesis) may also increase the risk for COPD. There exists much debate surrounding COPD and its relationship to asthma. Currently it is believed that both conditions lie along opposite ends of a spectrum. While both conditions cause limited airflow, the mechanisms and the permanence of the destruction differs. With COPD, the instigator is typically cigarette smoke, which leads to the release of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and CD8 T-cells. COPD typically affects the peripheral pulmonary pathways, eventually leading to parenchymal destruction, metaplasia of squamous cells and mucous causing irreversible airflow constriction. COPD does not respond well to steroid therapy. In contrast, asthma involves mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages and CD4 T-cells that become activated by exposure to allergens. Asthma affects the proximal pulmonary pathways leading to bronchoconstriction, fragile epithelial tissue, and mucous metaplasia, causing reversible airflow constriction which responds well to steroid therapy. In the event of severe asthma, there is more overlap between the two conditions, since neutrophils, macrophages, CD4 and CD8 T-cells are involved, which lead to airflow limitations of both proximal and peripheral airways. Severe asthma responds mildly to steroid therapy."

      "answers": [" Luteinizing hormone (LH)   "],
      "explanation": "At the beginning of the menstrual cycle, GnRH is released and stimulates the secretion of FSH and LH. FSH and LH cause growth of a follicle in the ovary. The oocyte and the glycoprotein surrounding the oocyte grow, forming the zona pellucida. FSH and LH stimulate the cells around the zona pellucida to secrete estrogen. As estrogen levels rise and the follicle matures, it completes meiosis, resulting in a secondary oocyte and a polar body. The increase in blood estrogen levels is detected by the pituitary gland; the pituitary responds by releasing LH, causing the mature secondary oocyte to rupture through the wall of the ovary and subsequent ovulation."

      "answers": [" The complement pathway   "],
      "explanation": "The complement pathway is activated in two different ways. Firstly, circulating complement can bind to an antigen-antibody complex and become activated. Another manner in which complement can be activated is by directly binding to bacterial surfaces. Once activated, complement causes a cascade of reactions that become amplified with each step. In one instance, membrane attack complexes are formed, which are essentially a group of proteins that form a pore through the membrane of the pathogen and cause lysis. Alternatively, complement may cause inflammation, which triggers phagocytes. Phagocytes possess receptors for complement and engulf the complement proteins that have bound to a microorganism. &#10;&#10;Fast-acting white blood cells include neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils. &#10;&#10;Lysozymes are enzymes found in tears, saliva, and the mucous that lines the lumen of the bronchi. This enzyme promotes the destruction of invading microorganisms."

      "answers": [" Pulling your hand away from a hot stove   "],
      "explanation": "A spinal reflex does not require input from the brain to achieve the goal at hand. The simplest form of a spinal reflex is a reflex arc that is monosynaptic. This type of pathway involves only one synapse. In its most basic form, a sensory neuron synapses directly onto a motor neuron in the spinal cord, allowing for an almost instant reaction to sensory input. These types of reflexes can be inhibited. For instance, when grasping a hot plate your initial reaction is to drop that plate; however, your brain can override this reaction because cognitively there are negative consequences to dropping the plate (i.e., it may break or the food may spill). Catching a ball, painting and dodging out of the way require the integration of visual input from the brain in order to correctly accomplish the task. Riding a bicycle successfully can be done without visual input; however feedback from the cerebellum is crucial in order to maintain balance."

      "answers": [" Meissner's corpuscles   "],
      "explanation": "There are several different types of receptors near the body's surface that serve to code and respond to different types of stimuli. The simplest of these receptors are free nerve endings, which are basically open nerve endings of sensory receptors in the skin. Free nerve endings respond to pain, touch, pressure, temperature, chemicals, and so forth. &#10;&#10;Encapsulated receptors are also found near the surface of the body and are surrounded by a capsule of either connective or epithelial tissue. Meissner's corpuscles are found more superficially and detect and adapt slowly to low-frequency vibrations. The end-bulb of Krause is important for reacting to temperatures less than twenty degrees Celsius. Ruffini endings respond to constant pressure and touch as well as temperatures above 45 degrees Celsius. Pacinian corpuscles (PC) are located deeper in the dermis and are sensitive to rapid pressure changes related to vibrations and touch. PCs are also found in some internal organs and in membranes that lie in close proximity to freely-movable joints."

      "answers": [" Memory T cells   "],
      "explanation": "Cell-mediated responses do not involve antibodies or complement. This type of immune response is controlled by cytotoxic T cells and helper T cells along with macrophages and cytokines. &#10;&#10;Antibody-mediated immune responses (sometimes called humoral response) involve memory B cells, effector B cells, and the production of antibodies as well as helper T cells. &#10;&#10;T and B cells both fall under the heading of lymphocyte. During an immune response, an antigen is swallowed by a macrophage. The antigens are broken apart into fragments and become bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules forming antigen-MHC complexes. The complexes are recognized by virgin cytotoxic T cells and virgin helper T cells. The virgin cytotoxic T cells divide into effector T cells and memory T cells. The virgin T helper cells undergo differentiation into memory T cells and effector helper T cells. The memory T cells are stored for future encounters. The effector helper T cells promote mitosis of T and B cells to help combat the pathogens. Helper T cells do not kill any pathogens but help direct the immune system and the appropriate cells. Cytotoxic T cells are also known as killer T cells because upon contact with a target, they inject chemicals that cause death to the target cell. Virgin B cells, upon activation by effector helper T cells and interleukins, begin mitosis and differentiate into memory B cells and effector B cells. The new memory B cells are stored for future encounters. The effector B cells produce antibodies which serve to inactivate the offending agent."

Neutrophils comprise the largest number of leukocytes, roughly two-thirds. These leukocytes seek and destroy cells that are infected or damaged. Eosinophils are involved in allergic responses as well as in mounting attacks against parasites. Basophils are the least common granulocyte and play a role in inflammatory as well as allergic reactions. Remember, neutrophils neutralize (a.k.a., they kill stuff). Eosinophils are 'eoitchy' (allergy). &#10;&#10;The second class of leukocytes are the agranulocytes, aptly named because they do not posses cytoplasmic granules. This class contains two types of cells: monocytes and lymphocytes. Monocytes become macrophages when necessary and destroy microbes or debris via phagocytosis. Lymphocytes (the T cells and B cells) are involved in hosting specific immune responses.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Leukocytes"

      "question": "You have a patient who you correctly diagnose with idiopathic demyelinating optic neuritis. The presence of which of the following characteristics on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) testing represents the greatest risk for the future development of multiple sclerosis?",
      "options": [
        " MRI shows one ovoid white matter lesion greater than 3mm in size  ",
        " MRI shows one ovoid grey matter lesion greater than 3mm in size  ",

        " MRI shows six or more grey matter lesions  "
      ],
      "answers": [" MRI shows six or more white matter lesions   "],
      "explanation": "Patients diagnosed with idiopathic optic neuritis are at a very high risk of subsequent development of multiple sclerosis; the risk can be as high as 74% at 15 years. The results of initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) testing are highly correlated with this risk and can help predict the chances of future development of multiple sclerosis (MS). &#10;&#10;• The overall risk for development of MS after optic neuritis is 50% (at 15 years) &#10;• When an MRI of the brain is normal, there is still a 23% chance of MS at 15 years &#10;• If a brain MRI shows one T-2 weighted ovoid lesion of the white matter (greater than 3mm in diameter), the 15-year risk of MS increases to 56% &#10;• The highest risk factor for MS is an MRI that shows at least six T2-weighted white matter lesions. These patients have a 74% chance of developing MS at 15 years. &#10;&#10;Therefore, patients with normal MRIs may develop MS, and patients with abnormal MRIs may never develop MS. It is important to closely follow these patients with regular eye examinations and to coordinate care with their primary care physician."

      "question": "A 34-year old patient walks into your office concerned with distance blurry vision. During review of her case history, she also reports that she cannot stand cold temperatures, her skin is very dry, she feels sluggish, depressed and her heart rate is slowed. Which of the following conditions do you suspect is the culprit of her systemic concerns?",
      "options": [" Myasthenia gravis  ", " Hyperthyroidism  ", " Grave's disease  ", " Cretinism  ", " Hypothyroidism   "],
      "answers": [" Hypothyroidism   "],
      "explanation": "The above case history is a textbook case of hypothyroidism. People who suffer from hypothyroidism are intolerant of the cold, have a slowed heart rate, display dry skin, possess dry, brittle nails and hair, have unintentional weight gain, and have feelings of sluggishness, fatigue, and depression. The most common treatment includes increasing TSH levels via medication (Levothyroxine). &#10;&#10;Individuals who suffer from hyperthyroidism often complain of increased heart and metabolic rates, heat intolerance, weight loss, trouble sleeping, and excessive nervousness. Hyperthyroidism can also lead to Grave's condition, an autoimmune disorder that attacks the thyroid gland and results in increased levels of thyroxine. A common sign of Grave's disease is proptosis caused by inflammation of orbital fat and the extraocular muscles. Treatment includes radioactive iodine to destroy thyroid function. &#10;&#10;Cretinism is a severe form of hypothyroidism that occurs in children due to a genetic defect that affects the thyroid gland of the fetus. Proper and early treatment is of essence; otherwise, the child's growth is stunted and mental retardation occurs. &#10;&#10;Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that results in a weakness of skeletal muscles. Muscle weakness worsens with activity but will improve with rest."

      "question": "A 33-year old female patient is seen at your office complaining of bilateral ptosis and diplopia that worsen towards the end of the day. Her pupils are round and equally reactive to light. She was recently seen by a neurologist, and all of her imaging scans were negative. She also reports difficulty swallowing and breathing. Given the above findings, what is the MOST likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [" Myasthenia gravis   ", " An aneurysm  ", " Cranial nerve III palsy  ", " Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)  "],
      "answers": [" Myasthenia gravis   "],
      "explanation": "Myasthenia gravis is caused by an autoimmune reaction in which the receptors for acetylcholine (Ach) on the motor endplate become destroyed. The decreased number of Ach receptors leads to weakness of voluntary muscles, which worsens with activity and improves with rest. Patients frequently report difficulty with swallowing and breathing. A ptosis may present bilaterally, or it may alternate between eyes along with extraocular muscle involvement causing diplopia. In-office testing will reveal a worsening of the ptosis after having the patient look up for about 20 seconds, which will cause muscle fatigue. Placing an ice pack on the eye will improve the ptosis, purportedly because the cool temperature will cause a decrease in acetylcholinesterase activity, allowing for greater amounts of Ach available in the neuromuscular junction. Another test to confirm a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis is the Tensilon (endrophonium chloride) test. Injection of Tensilon into a patient with myasthenia gravis will result in improvement of symptoms for roughly 5 minutes. However, the Tensilon test does have a slightly lower sensitivity rate and is an invasive procedure with potential complications. &#10;&#10;A cranial nerve III palsy, an aneurysm and CPEO will not display diurnal variations. An aneurysm will usually demonstrate pupil involvement and the patient frequently suffers from an extremely painful headache.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Myasthenia Gravis"

      "options": [" Myosin  ", " Calcium   ", " Adenosine triphosphate  ", " Acetylcholine  "],
      "answers": [" Calcium   "],
      "explanation": "Upon contraction of a muscle, calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This is a type of modified endoplasmic reticulum that surrounds myofibrils and is responsible for calcium storage and release. Upon release, the calcium binds to troponin which results in the movement of tropomyosin away from the binding site on the actin filament. Actin is then free to bind to myosin causing muscle contraction. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) initiates calcium uptake by the SR. In the absence of calcium, the binding site on the actin filament becomes blocked, allowing for muscle relaxation."

      "answers": [" Neurofibromatosis type I   "],
      "explanation": "Iris Lisch nodules, patchy hyperpigmentation of the skin (cafe au-lait spots) and small bump-like tumors that grow under the skin (neurofibromas) are characteristic features of neurofibromatosis type I (previously known as Von Recklinghausen disease). Neurofibromatosis type I (NF-1) is a human genetic disorder that is caused by mutations in neurofibromin. In addition to the previously mentioned signs, NF-1 also variably involves the brain, bones, adrenal glands, and vasculature, and can cause disturbances in puberty and growth. &#10;&#10;Neurofibromatosis type II (NF-2) also presents with neurofibromas; however, the appearance of cafe au-lait spots and Lisch nodules are generally not associated with this form of the disease. The main manifestation of NF-2 is the development of non-malignant tumors of the brain in the area of cranial nerve VIII (vestibulocochlear nerve). Visual symptoms can occur in NF-2 and are usually related to the development of posterior subcapsular cataracts."

      "answers": [" Polyarticular onset   "],
      "explanation": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), also known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), is a type of inflammatory arthritis that occurs in children under the age of 16, for a duration of at least 6 weeks. It is the most common form of arthritis in children and adolescents, as well as the most common systemic disease associated with childhood anterior uveitis. JIA is classified based upon the extent of joint involvement in the first 6 months of the disease. These subtypes are as follows: &#10;- Pauciarticular (aka Oligoarticular): JIA in which 4 or fewer joints are affected within the first 6 months. This type accounts for 50-60% of all cases of JIA, and uveitis affects about 20% of these children. Large joints are most commonly affected in these patients. &#10;- Polyarticular: JIA in which 5 or more joints are affected within the same time period. This type accounts for 20% of cases of JIA, and uveitis occurs in about 5% of these cases. Usually the smaller joints are affected in these children. &#10;- Systemic: In addition to polyarticular JIA, children with systemic JIA also experience symptoms such as fever and a salmon pink rash in conjunction with the arthritic conditions. This type of JIA typically involves both the small and large joints."

      "answers": [" Closing of the tricuspid and mitral valves   "],
      "explanation": "The primary sounds of the heart are caused by vibrations created by pressure differentials that occur during the closure of the heart valves. The opening of heart valves is typically very slow, occurring without an audible sound, while the rapid closure of the valves creates the 'lub-dub' sound that can be easily heard with a stethoscope. &#10;&#10;The first heart sound ('lub' or S1) arises from the closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves (also known as the atrioventricular valves). The mitral valve closes slightly earlier than the tricuspid valve because contraction of the ventricles begins with the left ventricle. &#10;&#10;The second heart sound ('dub' or S2) occurs as a result of the closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves (also known as the semilunar valves). The aortic valve closes just before the pulmonary valve due to the fact that the ejection of blood ends first in the left ventricle. &#10;&#10;Handbook of Cardiac Anatomy, Physiology, and Devices.

      "answers": [" Raeder's paratrigeminal neuralgia   "],
      "explanation": "Raeder's paratrigeminal neuralgia is a severe unilateral headache with periocular pain that follows the first distribution of the trigeminal nerve. In addition to the headache, these patients will also present with an ipsilateral Horner's syndrome. These symptoms may last from hours to weeks but will eventually resolve spontaneously. &#10;&#10;Ice-pick syndrome is characterized by multifocal, sharp, quick, intense pains that occur around the areas of the skull, face, and eyes. This can be differentiated from trigeminal neuralgia in that pain in these cases does not follow the anatomical distribution of the trigeminal nerve. &#10;&#10;Ophthalmoplegic migraines usually occur in patients under the age of 10. It is characterized by a recurrent, transient third nerve palsy, which develops after the headache. &#10;&#10;Cluster headaches are typically unilateral and oculotemporal in location, associated with deep, sharp, excruciating pain that may last 10 minutes to 2 hours. These headaches will typically occur on a daily basis for a period of several weeks; thus the name 'cluster.' &#10;&#10;Tension headaches are the most common type of primary headache in adults. The pain in these headaches usually radiates from the lower back of the head, the neck, or the eyes. The pain is commonly bilateral and is usually mild to moderate but can be severe in some patients."

ADH mainly targets the kidneys and arterioles, stimulating water retention by the kidneys, and increasing blood pressure by contracting the arterioles. Increased levels of ADH can also induce aggression in males. Oxytocin mainly targets the uterus and mammary glands, leading to uterine contractions and lactation in females. &#10;&#10;The anterior lobe of the pituitary gland (also known as adenohypophysis) secretes the other listed hormones (prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and thyroid stimulating hormone), in addition to follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and growth hormone."

      "answers": [" Afferent neurons   "],
      "explanation": "Afferent essentially means 'to bring to'. Afferent nerves carry sensory information to the central nervous system for processing. Efferent nerves carry signals away from the central nervous system to the body's effectors, which are motor neurons or glands. &#10;&#10;Autonomic nerves carry information from the central nervous system to smooth muscle, glands, and cardiac muscle. There are two types of autonomic nerves: those that deal with the sympathetic system and those that are allocated to the parasympathetic system. In general, these systems work antagonistically.&#10;PowerPage&#10;The Nervous System"

      "question": "Which of the following actions occurs by the body in response to a rise in environmental temperature?",
      "options": [" Pilomotor response  ", " Shivering  ", " Reduced muscle activity   ", " Vasoconstriction of blood vessels  "],
      "answers": [" Reduced muscle activity   "],
      "explanation": "In the event of an external rise in temperature, the body attempts to maintain a stable core temperature in several ways. Initially, the body signals for vasodilation of blood vessels in the skin. Dilation of vasculature close to the skin allows for dissipation of excess heat. The hypothalamus also promotes sweating via the sweat glands. The body also reduces the activity of its muscles in order to decrease heat production. Heat exhaustion occurs when too much water is lost from heavy sweating and increased vasodilation, causing a decrease in blood pressure. Heat exhaustion can lead to fainting. Heat stroke ensues when the core temperature of the body can no longer be adequately controlled. With heat stroke, sweating ceases and the body temperature rises to a point that may be lethal. &#10;&#10;In the presence of decreased temperatures, the body responds by peripheral vasoconstriction, promoting heat retention. Smooth muscle also contracts resulting in the pilomotor response (body hair is caused to stand erect, creating air pockets that serve to retain heat). The hypothalamus may also signal for the contraction of skeletal muscle, resulting in shivering that produces heat. If there is a prolonged drop in temperature, the body will react via non-shivering heat production, which increases the metabolic rate. This type of hormonal temperature control is most noteworthy in brown adipose tissue. Heat is generated by metabolism of this tissue. Brown adipose tissue is commonly found in the neck, armpits and near the kidneys of babies and people who are cold-adapted."

      "question": "Sound waves travel through the structures of the ear to the cochlea in which order?",
      "options": [
        " Pinna-> oval window-> the malleus-> the incus-> the stapes-> tympanic membrane-> cochlea  ",
        " Pinna-> tympanic membrane-> the malleus-> the incus-> the stapes-> oval window-> cochlea   ",

      ],
      "answers": [" Pinna-> tympanic membrane-> the malleus-> the incus-> the stapes-> oval window-> cochlea   "],
      "explanation": "Sound is funneled by the pinna (the outer ear) into the auditory canal to the tympanic membrane. Vibration of this membrane transfers the sound energy to the malleus (or the hammer) which then passes it to the incus (anvil) and on to the stapes (stirrup). The energy is transmitted to the oval window, which is considerably smaller than the tympanic membrane, causing amplification of the original sound vibrations. The oval window conveys the sound to the cochlea, a fluid-filled, snail-shaped apparatus consisting of the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani, which surround the central cochlear duct. It is within the cochlear duct that the magic happens. The floor of the cochlear duct houses the basilar membrane, which serves as a bed for the organ of Corti. Hair cells of the organ of Corti protrude upwards onto a membrane called the tectorial membrane. Sound waves cause the fluid in the cochlea to move, which vibrates the basilar membrane. This vibration in turn pushes the hair cells against the tectorial membrane, causing the hair cells to bend. The bent hair cells release a neurotransmitter, resulting in action potentials of the auditory nerve. Pressure waves travel through the cochlea and are released to the round window, which helps to release some pressure caused by the force of the sound waves."

      "options": [" Pituitary dwarfism  ", " Acromegaly   ", " Marfan's syndrome  ", " Gigantism  "],
      "answers": [" Acromegaly   "],
      "explanation": "Acromegaly is a condition that results from the synthesis and release of too much growth hormone during adulthood. In adults, the plates of long bones have fused and therefore are no longer capable of growth. In response to the growth hormone, bone and connective tissue of the jaw, hands, and feet will grow wider and thicker. The epithelia of the lips, eyelids, nose, and tongue will also continue to grow. &#10;&#10;Gigantism is caused by excessive release of the growth hormone during childhood resulting in a person that is abnormally taller than the average human. On the other hand, diminished levels of the growth hormone during childhood leads to an adult of small stature but of normal proportion when compared to an average adult (i.e., arms, legs, and body are shorter than an average person but of proper proportion for their body size). &#10;&#10;People afflicted with Marfan's syndrome have a genetic defect of their connective tissue and tend to be very tall with unusually long fingers and limbs."

      "answers": [" Pituitary gland   "],
      "explanation": "The sella turcica is a deep, saddle-shaped depression in the sphenoid bone of the skull that holds the pituitary gland. The floor (or seat of the saddle) is known as the hypophyseal fossa in which pituitary gland rests. Due to the configuration of the sella turcica, a tumor of the pituitary gland will typically extend upward into the suprasellar region, which can result in compression of the optic chiasm, causing a bitemporal hemianopic field defect."

      "answers": [" Memory T cells   "],
      "explanation": "Memory T cells are maintained after exposure to a vaccine or infectious agent and allow the body to mount a more rapid and pronounced specific immune response during subsequent exposures to the agent. Helper T cells are responsible for interacting with antigen-presenting cells and stimulating proliferation of specific B and T lymphocytes. Plasma cells are differentiated B cells with the principle function of antibody secretion. Suppressor T cells inhibit the response of specific B and T cells and play an important role in immune tolerance and suppression of autoimmune disease. Memory B cells and suppressor B cells have not been described."

      "answers": [" Apnea   "],
      "explanation": "Apnea occurs when breathing suddenly stops for a very brief instant and then resumes. Causes of apnea can include trauma, neurological disease, and drug effects, to name a few.&#10;&#10;A pneumothorax occurs when air collects in the space that surrounds the lung. This increases the pressure on the lung and may lead to its collapse. Common causes are chest trauma and lung diseases such as asthma or COPD; however, sometimes a pneumothorax may occur spontaneously. &#10;&#10;The pleural membranes of the lungs are separated by an intrapleural space filled with intrapleural fluid that serves to prevent the two membranes from rubbing against one another. Some illnesses like pneumonia can cause inflammation of the pleurae, leading to chafing and painful ventilation called pleurisy. &#10;&#10;Emphysema results in destruction of alveolar walls leading to decreased gas exchange. This condition is most commonly caused by smoking."

      "options": [" Prophase  ", " Anaphase  ", " Telophase  ", " Interphase  ", " Metaphase   "],
      "answers": [" Metaphase   "],
      "explanation": "The first stage of mitosis is prophase. During early prophase, DNA begins to condense inside of a nuclear envelope. During late prophase, the process involves further condensation of the chromosomes, the nuclear envelope, and the movement of one of a pair of centrioles to the other pole of the cell. During the transition into metaphase (sometimes called prometaphase), the centrioles send out microtubules, forming a spindle apparatus which attaches to sister chromatids of each chromosome. The microtubules attach at a site called a kinetochore on the centromere. At this time, the nuclear envelop has completely disintegrated. Metaphase is marked by the chromosomes aligning along the cellular equator, guided by the microtubules. Anaphase follows. During this phase the sister chromatids of each chromosome are pulled apart and are directed to opposite poles towards the centrioles by the microtubules. This is now telophase. During this stage, the chromosomes are no longer attached to the microtubules and begin to become less condensed. Nuclear envelopes also form around the de-condensing chromosomes, separating the DNA from the cytoplasm. At this point, cytoplasmic division begins and is generally complete before the end of telophase. Both new cells are diploid and contain the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. The cells then transition into interphase, in which the DNA is duplicated and the cytoplasm and its components increase in number. Interphase is the longest portion of the cell cycle and is not a part of mitosis. After interphase, the cell will then either move on to mitosis, or it will no longer divide."

      "options": [" Pseudostratified   ", " Simple squamous  ", " Simple  ", " Stratified  "],
      "answers": [" Pseudostratified   "],
      "explanation": "The throat, nasal passages, sinuses, and trachea are lined with pseudostratified columnar epithelium. This type of tissue is actually a type of modified simple epithelium. It is actually a single layer but resembles stratified tissue due to the placement of its nuclei. Pseudostratified epithelium generally possesses cilia to help sweep mucous or fluid across its surface. &#10;&#10;Simple epithelium is found lining the body's cavities, tubes, and ducts. It is composed of a single layer of cells which is important for its function of absorption, secretion, filtering or diffusion. Stratified epithelium comprises two or more layers of cells and serves an important role in protection. &#10;&#10;Epithelium always has one free surface whether it faces a lumen, cavity, or the environment. The other surface is anchored to a basement membrane."

      "answers": [" Giant cell arteritis   "],
      "explanation": "Giant cell arteritis (or temporal arteritis) is a granulomatous inflammatory vasculitis that has a predilection for medium and large-sized arteries. It particularly tends to affect the superficial temporal artery, and in some cases the ophthalmic, posterior ciliary, and proximal vertebral arteries as well. Characteristic features associated with giant cell arteritis include scalp tenderness that is typically noted when combing the hair, headache (which may be localized), pain and stiffness in the proximal muscle groups (which is typically worse in the morning), and other non-specific manifestations including neck pain, weight loss, malaise, fever, night sweats, and depression. Symptoms of intermittent jaw claudication are virtually pathognomonic in cases of giant cell arteritis. Pain in association with speaking and chewing occur due to ischemia of the masseter muscle. &#10;&#10;Polyarteritis nodosa is a collagen vascular disease that has a predilection for medium and small arteries. Tolosa-hunt syndrome is a rare condition that is characterized by extraocular nerve palsies including the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th cranial nerves. Ramsay hunt syndrome is a disorder that occurs secondary to reactivation of pre-existing herpes zoster virus in the nerve bundle of the facial nerve."

      "explanation": "The simplest form of a reflex arc is monosynaptic. This type of pathway involves only one synapse. In its most basic form, a sensory neuron synapses directly onto a motor neuron, allowing for almost instant reaction to sensory input. These types of reflexes can be inhibited. For instance, when grasping a hot plate, your initial reaction is to drop that plate; however, your brain can override this reaction because cognitively, there are negative consequences to dropping the plate (i.e., the plate may break or the food may spill). &#10;&#10;Reverberating circuits circle back onto themselves, creating a synapse loop. Eye muscle twitching while asleep is one example of this type of neuron activity. &#10;&#10;Retrograde essentially refers to backward motion. Axonal transport of some materials is classified as retrograde transport. Molecules that require recycling (or the need to be broken down) travel from the axon back to the cell body for degradation by lysozymes."

A dose of riboflavin 400 mgs per day has been shown to reduce the occurrence of migraine attacks as has COQ10 (usually 100 mg twice a day) or magnesium, usually 400 mgs twice a day. Supplements combining all three are available. The herb feverfew has also been shown to produce migraine health prophylaxis. Many drugs are prescribed for the reduction of frequency for various migraine attacks. Currently prominent ones are the beta blockers, tricyclic antidepressants (particularly Elavil), and some of the newer anticonvulsants, particularly Topamax. Topamax has been associated with large refractive error changes."

      "answers": [" Right atrium-> right ventricle-> pulmonary artery-> lungs-> pulmonary vein-> left atrium   "],
      "explanation": "Deoxygenated blood from the tissues enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior vena cava. Blood is then transported past the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. The right ventricle contracts causing closure of the valve and forcing blood through the open right semilunar valve into the main pulmonary artery. The blood is then delivered to the lungs where it becomes oxygenated and rids itself of carbon dioxide. The newly oxygenated blood is then transferred to the pulmonary veins where it travels to the left atrium."

      "options": [" Right lower motor neuron  ", " Left lower motor neuron  ", " Left upper motor neuron  ", " Right upper motor neuron   "],
      "answers": [" Right upper motor neuron   "],
      "explanation": "A unilateral lesion to an upper motor neuron of the facial nerve will only affect the muscles of the lower face on the contralateral side. This is due to the fact that the upper portion of the face has bilateral innervation, while the lower portions of the face have unilateral innervation. &#10;&#10;The branch of the facial nerve that serves the upper portion of the face receives innervation from both the right and left corticobulbar tracts, while the branch of the facial nerve that serves the lower portion of the face only receives innervation from the contralateral side of the brain. &#10;&#10;Therefore, if there is damage to the fibers of the right corticobulbar tract (right upper motor neuron), there will not be any facial weakness of the upper portion of the face because the fibers from the left corticobulbar tract will innervate both the right and left sides of the upper face. Thus, in this case there will only be weakness of the lower portion of the contralateral (left) side of the face as the lower portion of the face receives only unilateral innervation from the contralateral side of the brain. &#10;&#10;Motor Speech Disorders: Diagnosis and Treatment (Second edition).

      "answers": [" End-bulbs of Krause   "],
      "explanation": "There are several different types of receptors near the body's surface that serve to code and respond to different types of stimuli. The simplest of these receptors are free nerve endings, which are basically open nerve endings of sensory receptors in the skin. Free nerve endings respond to pain, touch, pressure, temperature, chemicals, and so forth. &#10;&#10;Encapsulated receptors are also found near the surface of the body and are surrounded by a capsule of either connective or epithelial tissue. Meissner's corpuscles are found more superficially and detect and adapt slowly to low-frequency vibrations. The end-bulb of Krause is important for reacting to temperatures less than twenty degrees Celsius. Ruffini endings respond to constant pressure and touch as well as temperatures above 45 degrees Celsius. Pacinian corpuscles (PC) are located deeper in the dermis and are sensitive to rapid pressure changes related to vibrations and touch. PCs are also found in some internal organs and in membranes that lie in close proximity to freely-movable joints."

      "options": [" Saccule  ", " Semicircular canals  ", " Utricle  ", " Organ of Corti   "],
      "answers": [" Organ of Corti   "],
      "explanation": "The inner ear contains the cochlea. The floor of the cochlear duct houses the basilar membrane, which serves as a bed for the organ of Corti. Hair cells of the organ of Corti protrude upwards onto a membrane called the tectorial membrane. Sound waves cause the fluid in the cochlea to move, which vibrates the basilar membrane. This vibration in turn pushes the hair cells against the tectorial membrane and causes the hair cells to bend. The bent hair cells release a neurotransmitter, resulting in action potentials of the auditory nerve. &#10;&#10;The semicircular canals are a part of the vestibular apparatus along with the utricle and saccule. The semicircular canals are positioned at right angles to each other and help to code for acceleration, deceleration, and rotational head movements (angular acceleration). The semicircular canals are filled with fluid (endolymph). At the base of the canals are the ampullae that rest atop specialized hair cells that bend in response to the movement of fluid, allowing for processing by the brain. &#10;&#10;The utricle and the saccule are sac-like, filled with fluid, and help to detect linear acceleration. These structures contain small calcium carbonate stones called otoliths. Each sac contains hair cells embedded in a jelly-like mass along with the otoliths. Movements of the mass and the otoliths signal a change in position of the head or body. Movement at constant speed will not be detected by these structures because the otoliths eventually come to equilibrium."

      "answers": [" Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)   "],
      "explanation": "Lupus is associated with facial redness known as the malar flush or butterfly rash that appears as confluent erythema over the cheeks and bridge of the nose. The mouth and forehead may also be involved. It is suspected when people have a reddish face. Rosacea is associated with redness of the face and is typically associated with telangiectasia. In rosacea, the central portion of the face is predominantly affected, particularly the nose, however, any area of the face may be involved. Seborrhoeic dermatitis also creates redness but is generally in the nasal labial fold and appears as a scaly rash. The conjunctival injection is suggestive of ocular rosacea; this can be a challenging problem to treat, with keratitis being the most severe ocular consequence, however the nature of the presenting facial redness is not suggestive of rosacea."

This condition is caused by restriction of blood flow to the extremities such as the fingers and toes, causing numbness or an excessively cool sensation, when exposed to decreased temperatures or stress. The Troxler effect is noted when individuals stare at a central fixation point and the peripheral targets disappear; this is observed regularly by patients while performing perimetry. The Riddoch phenomenon refers to the fact that a stimulus is only observed when it is in motion, and cannot be detected by the observer when it is static. The Riddoch phenomenon may be reported by individuals who suffer from an occipital lobe lesion, optic nerve damage, or chiasmal damage. The Stiles Crawford effect I refers to the fact that photoreceptors are more sensitive to light rays from the center of the pupil than to light rays entering from periphery."

The gray matter is compacted towards the center of the cord and cross-sectionally resembles a butterfly pattern. This is in opposition to the brain, in which the gray matter is found on the outside of the cranium and the white matter is located internally. White matter is comprised of bundles of myelinated tracts of nerves. The white appearance is attributable to the myelination. Grey matter is composed of dendrites, axonal cellular bodies, glial cells as well as interneurons."

      "options": [" Substantia nigra   ", " Thalamus  ", " Pineal gland  ", " Cerebellum  ", " Primary motor cortex  "],
      "answers": [" Substantia nigra   "],
      "explanation": "Parkinson' disease is degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that is characterized by a progressive difficulty of motor movements which results in symptoms of shakiness, rigidity, slow movements, and problems with gait. Eventually, thinking and behavioral issues, along with depression may arise in more advanced stages. &#10;&#10;The cause of Parkinson's disease is a result of degeneration and death of the dopaminergic neurons of the area of the brain known as the substantia nigra. The substantia nigra is located in the brainstem and forms close connections with the basal ganglia in the cerebral hemispheres. The degeneration that occurs in the substantia nigra causes a lack of dopaminergic activity to the basal ganglia, which is involved in the production of voluntary movements. It is this type of movement that patients with Parkinson's disease show great difficulty with."

      "answers": [" Surfactant   "],
      "explanation": "Cells of the alveolar epithelium secrete pulmonary surfactant to reduce the surface tension of the alveoli; this helps to prevent their collapse. &#10;&#10;The pleural membranes are separated by an intrapleural space filled with intrapleural fluid that serves to prevent the two membranes from rubbing against one another. Some illnesses like pneumonia can cause inflammation of the pleurae, leading to chafing and painful ventilation called pleurisy. &#10;&#10;Angiotensin causes constriction of blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. Angiotensin I is converted to Angiotensin II by the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which is found in the greatest density in the lungs."

      "answers": [" Fontanels   "],
      "explanation": "Fontanels, also known as soft spots, are found on a newborn baby's skull between the bony plates. During childhood, the skull joints harden to create sutures which later on in life completely fuse. &#10;&#10;Synovial joints are the most common type of joint. This joint type separates bones via a cavity, and the involved ends of the bones are covered with a layer of cartilage that helps to cushion the joint. Cells that line the capsules secrete fluid called synovial fluid into the cavity of the joint. Ball-and-socket joints allow for a full range of movement. Hinge-like joints, like the knee and elbow, allow for movement in one plane. &#10;&#10;Skull invasions is a term meant to distract."

      "answers": [" Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome   "],
      "explanation": "Kaposi sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that can affect both the skin and internal organs in certain individuals. It usually presents with tumors on the skin or mucosal surfaces, but lesions may also develop in other parts of the body (such as lymph nodes or the digestive tract). Unlike most types of cancer, the underlying cause for the development of Kaposi sarcoma has been identified. This condition occurs as a result of infection with the human herpes virus type 8. This specific virus is very prevalent; however, it does not lead to the development of Kaposi sarcoma in most individuals. Persons with diminished immune systems due to certain medications, hereditary factors, or systemic illnesses can be more vulnerable to the effects of the virus, increasing their risk for developing this type of cancer. The most common subtype of Kaposi sarcoma is HIV/AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma. These individuals may have severely weakened immune systems, which can allow the herpes virus to multiply and eventually lead to this type of cancer. Kaposi sarcoma is considered an 'AIDS-defining' illness due to the fact that when it occurs in a person diagnosed with HIV, that person then officially has converted to having AIDS."

      "answers": [" Grave's disease   "],
      "explanation": "Pretibial myxedema is an infiltrative dermopathy that is most commonly associated with Grave's disease; however, it may also be found in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. It typically presents as waxy, discolored, raised plaques of non-pitting edema of the skin. These skin findings are most commonly found on the anterior aspect of the lower legs and extending on to the dorsum of the foot; however, they may also extend to the torso and chest, upper extremities, face, neck, back and the ears. Pretibial myxedema is an uncommon manifestation of thyroid disease; it occurs only in about 1-5% of patients with Grave's disease, and in up to about 15% of patients with both Grave's disease and ophthalmopathy. &#10;&#10;In order to confirm the diagnosis of pretibial myxedema, a biopsy of the skin can be performed, which will reveal mucin in the mid to lower layers of the dermis. This occurs as a result of the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (especially hyaluronic acid) in the dermis."

      "explanation": "Neutrophils and macrophages can both act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and do not require APC activation. Natural killer cells are lymphocytes that are neither T nor B in phenotype. They can respond against virally infected cells and some tumor cells, but they do not have specific antigen recognition sites. CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes interact primarily with major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I) directly on infected cells. CD4+ T helper cells interact with MHC II on APCs, which activates them to stimulate other B and T cells to proliferate. These cells must recognize the specific antigen on an antigen-presenting cell to become activated."

      "explanation": "Food and beverage fortification entails the addition of essential micronutrients to foods to increase their nutritional value while posing a minimal risk to health. Many countries (by law) have added vitamins to staple foods to help decrease sickness while promoting health. For example, Canada legally requires that liquid milk and margarine be fortified with vitamin D, because during the winter months where there is minimal sun exposure, many people suffer from hypovitaminosis D. The amount of vitamin D that is added is strictly controlled, as there exists the risk for toxicity if ingested in large quantities."

      "question": "Your patient reports that when she sits for long periods and then gets up rapidly, her vision is transiently filled with 'stars and static' for a few seconds, and she also feels momentarily light-headed. What is the MOST likely etiology of this phenomenon?",
      "options": [" Tardive dyskinesia  ", " Peripheral neuropathy  ", " Orthostatic hypotension   ", " Vasovagal syncope  "],
      "answers": [" Orthostatic hypotension   "],
      "explanation": "Postural hypotension, also known as orthostatic hypotension, is a result of blood pooling in the lower extremities due to gravitational forces when a change of position from sitting or lying down to standing occurs. This results in transiently decreased blood pressure. Typically, the baroreceptors in arteries of the neck and heart detect a decrease in blood pressure and stabilize the body against this change by narrowing the lumen of the vessels, enhancing resistance to blood flow as well as signaling the heart to beat faster. Orthostatic hypotension results when something interrupts either this feedback or the process of the body's counteraction of this momentary decrease in blood pressure. Generally, postural hypotension is not a cause for concern. Some conditions that may render patients more prone to experiencing postural hypotension are diabetes, dehydration, cardiovascular disease, or disorders/diseases of the nervous system. &#10;&#10;Peripheral neuropathy occurs as a result of damage to the peripheral nervous system, causing an interruption of its ability to transmit signals from the central nervous system to various body parts. Patients may report an array of symptoms including tingling, pain, and/or numbing or paralysis of the extremities. &#10;&#10;Vasovagal syncope is the result of a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, leading to a temporary loss of consciousness. This typically occurs as the body's over-reactive response to some type of external stimuli. &#10;&#10;Tardive dyskinesia literally translates to delayed, abnormal movement. This condition generally manifests as a side effect of certain medications, particularly antipsychotic medications such as prochlorperazine, haloperidol, chlorpromazine and metoclopramide, among others. The most commonly observed abnormal movements involve the muscles of the face, resulting in grimacing, repetitive mastication, or tongue thrusting."

      "options": [" Tay-Sachs  ", " Menopause  ", " Hyperglycemia  ", " Hypoglycemia   "],
      "answers": [" Hypoglycemia   "],
      "explanation": "Cortisol is classified as a glucocorticoid and is produced by the adrenal cortex that lies just above the kidney. This hormone triggers the catabolism of protein in muscle and causes the liver to take up amino acids to promote the production of glucose. Cortisol also signals for the breakdown of fat. When blood glucose levels are elevated, a negative feedback loop inhibits the hypothalamus from secreting the corticotropin-releasing hormone and inhibits the anterior pituitary from secreting the adrenocorticotropic hormone inhibiting the release of cortisol from the adrenal cortex. People who suffer from chronic low levels of cortisol can develop hypoglycemia. &#10;&#10;Tay-Sachs disease is a recessive genetic disorder resulting from the lack of an important enzyme, causing the build-up of proteins in nerve cells of the brain. There exist several forms of the disease: infantile, juvenile, and adult, with infantile being the most common and fatal."

      "question": "A 43 year-old patient is referred to your office for further evaluation of her headaches. She reports that the headaches are moderate-to-severe, they occur almost daily, and are worse in the mornings when she wakes up and generally lessen or abate during the day. She reports that drinking black caffeinated coffee first thing in the morning usually makes her headaches go away. Based upon the case history alone, what is the MOST likely type of headache that she is experiencing?",
      "options": [" Tension headache  ", " Nasal sinusitis headache  ", " Hypertension headache   ", " Migraine headaches  "],
      "answers": [" Hypertension headache   "],
      "explanation": "Hypertension headaches typically occur secondary to poor control of blood pressure. This type of headache is typically described by patients as severe and is worse in the morning. Hypertension headaches are generally present upon awakening and abate at some point during the day. Many patients report that the headaches can be lessened or eliminated by drinking black caffeinated coffee. &#10;&#10;Tension headaches, also known as muscular contraction headaches, are most commonly caused by stress and may be also be attributed to poor posture, hunger and fatigue. This type of headache is associated with stiffness of the muscles in the neck region and pain around the occipital region or a vice-like pain in the frontal area. Patients typically report the presence of a throbbing pain. Tension headaches are the most common type of headache. &#10;&#10;Migraine headaches are thought to be neurological in nature and can be triggered by several mechanisms such as hormonal changes or neurotransmitter imbalances. A typical presentation of a patient suffering from a migraine headache will include unilateral pain that is pulsating in nature and lasts from 2-72 hours. Patients will typically experience associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. Up to 30% of patients will perceive an aura immediately preceding the headache that typically involves transient visual disturbances, as well as sensory, language, or motor disruptions. Some migraine attacks can be suspended by the ingestion of strong coffee. &#10;&#10;Sinus headaches are commonly associated with a deep and constant pain in the location of the cheekbones, forehead, or bridge of the nose. Pain in these cases is usually associated with other sinus symptoms such as rhinorrhea, feeling of fullness in the ears, fever, facial swelling, and lacrimation. Patients typically report a transient loss of the sense of smell. The majority of patients will note an increase in pain/pressure when bending down. &#10;&#10;Primary Care Optometry 5th edition.

      "options": [" Tension headache  ", " Classical migraine   ", " Cluster headache  ", " Common migraine  "],
      "answers": [" Classical migraine   "],
      "explanation": "A classical migraine is characterized by the presence of a visual aura that precedes the development of the headache. The visual aura typically lasts about 20 minutes and usually consists of visual symptoms that may include bright or dark spots, zig-zagged lines, jig-saw puzzle effects, scintillating scotomas, or tunnel vision. Eventually, the visual disturbance will expand and drift toward the peripheral portion of the vision before it breaks up and disappears. In a classical migraine case, the headache will follow the aura by about 30 minutes. Pain is usually hemicranial and may be accompanied by nausea and light sensitivity. &#10;&#10;Common migraines are categorized by a headache with associated autonomic nervous system dysfunction but without the visual auras that are characteristic of a classical migraine. &#10;&#10;Cluster headaches do not usually involve visual symptoms as classical migraines do. They are typically unilateral and oculotemporal in location, associated with deep, sharp, excruciating pain that may last 10 minutes to 2 hours. These headaches will typically occur on a daily basis for a period of several weeks; thus, the name 'cluster' is often used. &#10;&#10;Tension headaches are the most common type of primary headache in adults. The pain in these headaches usually radiates from the lower back of the head, the neck, or the eyes. The pain is commonly bilateral and is usually mild to moderate but can be severe in some patients. These headaches do not present with a visual aura preceding the pain."

Naturally, fine motor skills require more coordination and thus have a greater cortical representation. Remember, the primary motor cortex of the right hemisphere controls the left side of the body and vice versa. A large portion of cortex is afforded to the lips, tongue, and thumb because they require precise control."

      "answers": [" The acrosome   "],
      "explanation": "The human male sperm is comprised of a head, a mid-piece, and a tail. The head contains DNA as well as a cap-containing enzyme called an acrosome that helps the sperm to penetrate the egg for fertilization. The mid-piece is rich in mitochondria and serves to give the sperm energy in order for the tail to propel it to the egg. Sertoli cells line the seminiferous tubules and secrete chemicals as well as offer nourishment to developing sperm in the testicles. Lysozyme is found in many bodily secretions such as tears and saliva and is an immune-defensive mechanism used to destroy unwanted bacteria."

      "options": [" The cochlea  ", " The pinna   ", " The oval window  ", " The Eustachian tube  "],
      "answers": [" The pinna   "],
      "explanation": "The pinna, also called the auricle, is located outside of the head and serves to channel sound towards the middle and in turn to the inner ear and brain for processing. &#10;&#10;The Eustachian tube runs from the middle ear to the pharynx. When pressure builds inside the ear, the tube helps to circumvent the excess pressure, allowing for equalization of air pressure between the middle ear and the atmosphere. Rapid change in altitude can result in ear 'popping' due to this equalization process. &#10;&#10;Sound is funneled by the pinna (the outer ear) into the auditory canal to the tympanic membrane. Vibration of this membrane transfers the sound energy to the malleus (or the hammer) which then passes it to the incus (anvil) and on to the stapes (stirrup). The energy is transmitted to the oval window, which, being considerably smaller than the tympanic membrane causes amplification of the original sound vibrations. The oval window conveys the sound to the cochlea, a fluid-filled, snail shell-shaped apparatus consisting of the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani surrounding the central cochlear duct. It is within the cochlear duct that the magic happens. The floor of the cochlear duct houses the basilar membrane, which serves as a bed for the organ of Corti. Hair cells of the organ of Corti protrude upwards onto a membrane called the tectorial membrane. Sound waves cause the fluid in the cochlea to move, vibrating the basilar membrane. This vibration in turn pushes the hair cells against the tectorial membrane and causes the hair cells to bend. The bent hair cells release a neurotransmitter, resulting in action potentials of the auditory nerve. Pressure waves travel through the cochlea and are released to the round window, which helps to release some of the pressure caused by the force of the sound waves."

      "answers": [" The hippocampus   "],
      "explanation": "The hippocampus belongs to the limbic system and plays a large role in the formation of new memories. This is one of the first target sites of Alzheimer's disease. &#10;&#10;The brain is divided into two hemispheres, both of which are capable of functioning independently. In terms of function, the left hemisphere is thought largely to govern spoken language skills while the right houses the centers for math, music and other nonverbal, abstract thinking. The two hemispheres are connected by a nerve tract called the corpus callosum which facilitates communication between the two sides. &#10;&#10;The inferior olivary nucleus is thought to play a role in motor function and motor learning as it is closely associated with the cerebellum. &#10;&#10;The tectum lies in the midbrain and is responsible for the integration of visual and auditory input."

      "answers": [" The ductus venosus   "],
      "explanation": "The liver of the mother handles to majority of the liver functions of the fetus; therefore, blood is shunted away from this organ until it becomes fully needed at birth. Oxygenated blood from the placenta passes through the venous duct, bypasses the liver, and is delivered to the heart, where it then moves on to to be circulated to the body. This duct slowly becomes inoperational a few weeks after birth. &#10;&#10;Essentially, the foramen ovale essentially acts as a door between the right and left atria, allowing for passage of oxygenated blood from the mother's placenta to the brain of the fetus. Basically, the majority of blood enters the atria and is shunted into the arterial duct, which bypasses the lungs. However, once the newborn takes its first few breaths, the left atrium fills with blood that has been returned from the lungs, effectively closing the hole. &#10;&#10;The umbilical cord is the connection from the fetus to the mother. Gas and waste exchange occur through this meshwork of tissue and blood vessels."

      "answers": [" The left atrium and the left ventricle   "],
      "explanation": "The mitral valve, also known as the bicuspid valve serves to prevent backwards blood flow between the left ventricle and the left atrium (Note: a good way to remember mitraL = Left side of heart, the Ls go together). The right atrioventricular valve has three cusps and is termed the tricuspid valve. This valve prevents blood from being pumped from the right ventricle back into the right atrium. The semilunar valves are found between the ventricles and their respective arteries. The left ventricle pumps blood into the aorta, and the right ventricle drains into the pulmonary artery."

      "explanation": "The secretion of HCG by the blastocyst is vital for a proper pregnancy as it signals to the corpus luteum (which is formed by cells that once made up the ovarian follicle) to continue secreting progesterone and estrogen. The continual release of these hormones maintains the uterine lining and inhibits menstruation which, if not paused, would cause a miscarriage. Many companies have profited from the fact that HCG levels can be detected in the urine of a pregnant mother; this led to the creation of home pregnancy tests."

      "explanation": "The medulla is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid. Should the levels of carbon dioxide in the body become too elevated, the partial pressure of increased carbon dioxide causes a decrease in the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid. This stimulates the respiratory center in the brain to increase the breathing rate and depth to diminish carbon dioxide levels. &#10;&#10;The pons is involved in regulating information between the cerebellum and the integration centers of the forebrain. &#10;&#10;The pineal gland serves to regulate circadian rhythms &#10;&#10;The midbrain mainly serves to coordinate visual, auditory, and tactile input."

      "answers": [" The mitral and tricuspid valves close, the atria relax and the semilunar valves open  "],
      "explanation": "The cardiac cycle begins with contraction of the atria, causing blood to enter the ventricles (which are relaxed) through the mitral and tricuspid valves (or the atrioventricular or AV valves). The semilunar valves are closed during atrial contraction. Upon filling of the ventricles, they contract while the atria relax. The semilunar valves open and the AV valves are forced closed. Blood from the right ventricle proceeds to the pulmonary arteries; blood from the left ventricle passes to the aorta. The semilunar valves close proceeded by brief relaxation of the atria and ventricles. The atria fill and contract and the cardiac cycle begins again."

      "explanation": "When an Rh- mother becomes pregnant with a fetus that is Rh+ (due to paternal genes), she will develop antibodies against that blood marker but only once the two blood types have mixed either across the placenta or during delivery. If the mother becomes pregnant again and the child is Rh+, maternal antibodies will then enter the bloodstream of the fetus and cause lysis of the blood cells, potentially causing death. &#10;&#10;This incompatibility of the blood types can be treated to avoid fetal complications. The mother may be injected with Rhogam (anti-Rh gamma globulin) which will lead to inactivation of the Rh+ antibodies. &#10;&#10;Eosinophils do not normally play a big role in blood type incompatibility, nor do eosinophils possess phagocytosis capabilities-especially of fetal tissue.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Blood Typing"

      "explanation": "The semicircular canals are a part of the vestibular apparatus along with the utricle and saccule. The utricle and the saccule are sac-like, fluid-filled, and help to detect linear acceleration. These structures contain small calcium carbonate stones called otoliths. Each sac contains hair cells embedded in a jelly-like mass along with the otoliths. Movements of the mass and the otoliths signal a change in position of the head or body. Movement at constant speed will not be detected by these structures because the otoliths eventually come to equilibrium. &#10;&#10;The semicircular canals are positioned at right angles to each other and help to code for acceleration, deceleration, and rotational head movements (angular acceleration).

      "question": "Which of the following structures of the brain is a part of the limbic system and is involved in emotions?",
      "options": [" The pons  ", " Lateral geniculate nucleus  ", " Amygdala   ", " Corpus callosum  "],
      "answers": [" Amygdala   "],
      "explanation": "Primary structures of the limbic system include the amygdala, the hippocampus and regions of the septal area, and the limbal cortex which includes the hypothalamus, the cingulate gyrus, and the fornix. These areas are responsible for governing many of our emotions and feelings of motivation, especially those that deal with survival. &#10;&#10;The brain is divided into two hemispheres, both of which are capable of functioning independently. In terms of function, the left hemisphere is thought largely to govern spoken language skills while the right houses the centers for math, music and other nonverbal, abstract thinking. The two hemispheres are connected by a nerve tract called the corpus callosum which facilitates communication between the two sides. &#10;&#10;The optic tracts of the eyes terminate onto the lateral geniculate nuclei (LGN) located in the thalamus. This layered structure contains cells that process form, color, and motion. Information is passed from the LGN to the primary visual cortex for further processing. &#10;&#10;The pons is involved in regulating information between the cerebellum and the integration centers of the forebrain."

      "question": "Which of the following occurs during inspiration?",
      "options": [" The pressure in the alveolar sacs exceeds the atmospheric pressure  ", " The thoracic cavity decreases  ", " The rib cage is pulled down and in  ", " The diaphragm contracts   "],
      "answers": [" The diaphragm contracts   "],
      "explanation": "The respiratory cycle is comprised of inhalation and expiration. Inhalation is an active process that requires energy. Inhalation is stimulated when air pressure in the pleural sac is lower than the atmospheric pressure. The pressure difference causes the lungs to expand. The diaphragm flattens and the thoracic cavity expands as the external intercostal muscles pull the rib cage up and outward. During exhalation, the lungs recoil, causing the pressure of air in the alveolar sacs to exceed the atmospheric pressure and air flows out of the lungs. Normal or 'quiet' exhalation is passive and does not require energy. Forced exhalation, such as during exercise, requires the expenditure of energy and recruits the internal intercostal muscles and the muscles of the abdominal wall to reduce the volume of the thoracic cavity."

      "question": "Which portion of a nephron is NEVER permeable to water?",
      "options": [" The proximal tubule  ", " The distal tubule  ", " The ascending limb of the loop of Henle   ", " The descending limb of the loop of Henle  ", " The glomerular apparatus  "],
      "answers": [" The ascending limb of the loop of Henle   "],
      "explanation": "The ascending portion of the loop of Henle is not permeable to water. The distal tubule can be permeable to water but only under the influence of the antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Water and solutes get filtered by the glomerulus into Bowman's capsule. Sodium ions are actively transported across the membrane of the proximal tubule into the interstitial fluid. Because sodium ions are positively charged, chloride, bicarbonate, and other ions follow sodium out of the tubule. The increased concentration of this interstitial fluid outside of the tubule causes water to move via osmosis out of the tubule (which IS permeable to water) into the interstitial fluid. &#10;&#10;As the filtrate moves through the descending limb of the loop of Henle, water continues to exit into the interstitial fluid, which begins to increase in solute concentration inside the tubule. This cycle continues until the solute concentration inside the tubule matches that of the interstitial fluid. Once the ascending loop of Henle is reached, water is no longer able to leave the tubule, but sodium ions are continuously actively transported outwards. This causes the concentration of the solute to be much higher in the surrounding interstitial fluid of the medulla, which actually serves to drive water out of the tubule in the descending limb of the loop of Henle. All of the above leads to an increased concentration of solutes within the deeper portion of the medulla; this is also attributable to remaining urea in the medulla that had not been excreted. Once the filtrate reaches the distal tubule, it is quite diluted."

      "options": [" The renal pelvis  ", " The cortex  ", " The renal capsule  ", " The medulla   "],
      "answers": [" The medulla   "],
      "explanation": "The loop of Henle ascends into the medulla of the kidney and serves to create a concentration gradient, driving the reabsorption of water. There are two types of nephrons; cortical nephrons and juxtamedullary nephrons. Cortical nephrons tend to be shorter, and their loops of Henle may enter into the medulla but only to a shallow extent. In contrast, the juxtamedullary nephrons possess a much longer loop of Henle that penetrates deep into the medulla. The kidney is divided into three parts; the renal capsule encloses the kidney, followed by a thicker cortex (this is where the renal corpuscles of the nephrons are located), then innermost portion, termed the medulla. The juxtamedullary nephrons control the concentration of urine."

      "options": [" The right ventricle  ", " The left ventricle   ", " The left atrium  ", " The right atrium  "],
      "answers": [" The left ventricle   "],
      "explanation": "Blood pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted upon the vessels walls by the blood. During systole, the pressure is higher because the left ventricle is contracting and forcing blood into the aorta. Diastole occurs as the heart relaxes and blood flows out of the aorta. Diastolic pressure is the lowest measure of blood pressure exerted on the vessels walls, while systolic pressure measures the greatest amount of pressure on the blood vessel walls. Remember, the left ventricle contains more muscle due to the fact that it must pump blood throughout the whole body; the right ventricle forces blood to the lungs only."

      "answers": [" The semicircular canals   "],
      "explanation": "The semicircular canals are a part of the vestibular apparatus along with the utricle and saccule. The semicircular canals are positioned at right angles to each other and help to code for acceleration, deceleration, and rotational head movements (angular acceleration). The semicircular canals are filled with fluid (endolymph). At the base of the canals are the ampullae that rest atop specialized hair cells that bend in response to the movement of fluid, allowing for processing by the brain. &#10;&#10;The utricle and the saccule are sac-like, filled with fluid, and help to detect linear acceleration. These structures contain small calcium carbonate stones called otoliths. Each sac contains hair cells embedded in a jelly-like mass along with the otoliths. Movements of the mass and the otoliths signal a change in position of the head or body. Movement at constant speed will not be detected by these structures because the otoliths eventually come to equilibrium."

      "answers": [" The cells of Leydig   "],
      "explanation": "The cells of Leydig, also known as interstitial cells of Leydig, are located in the tissue between the seminiferous tubules. These cells synthesize and secrete the testosterone hormone, which is imperative for growth and function of the male reproductive system. Sertoli cells line the seminiferous tubules and secrete chemicals and offer nourishment to developing sperm in the testicles.

The sperm are stored here until ejaculation during which the sperm are propelled down the vas deferens, through the ejaculatory ducts and the urethra. The prostate is an accessory gland, along with the seminal vesicles and bulbourethral gland, which help to provide semen and the media necessary for sperm survival."

      "answers": [" Preganglionic fibers are short and postganglionic fibers are long   ", " It is also known as the 'fright, fight, or flight' system   "],
      "explanation": "Postganglionic fibers of the sympathetic system release norepinephrine. The neurotransmitter released between the preganglionic and postganglionic fibers is acetylcholine. This is in contrast to the parasympathetic nervous system, wherein the neurotransmitter released between the preganglionic and postganglionic fibers is acetylcholine, which is also released by the postganglionic fibers. The sympathetic nervous system is also known as the 'fright, fight, or flight' system; whereas the parasympathetic nervous system is sometimes referred to as the 'rest and digest' system. The sympathetic nervous system has a thoracolumbar outflow; the parasympathetic nervous system has a craniosacral outflow. &#10;&#10;Sympathetic fibers innervate the dilator muscles of the iris and cause mydriasis of the pupil."

      "options": [" The uterus  ", " The fallopian tube   ", " The cervix  ", " The ovary  "],
      "answers": [" The fallopian tube   "],
      "explanation": "The fallopian tubes (also known as the oviducts) are generally the site of fertilization. The egg is released from the ovary and is directed into the oviducts via fimbriae, the finger-like extensions of the fallopian tubes that act like beating cilia to move the egg into the tubes. Once fertilization occurs, rapid cell division creates an embryo that continues to travel down the fallopian tubes for about 3 or 4 days before it moves into the uterus; here it will implant itself onto the uterine wall. The cervix secretes mucus to help sperm motility and also serves to help protect the developing fetus from bacterial infections (post-fertilization)."

      "explanation": "The ovaries produce oocytes as well as the female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone. The oviducts serve as a passageway for eggs from the ovaries to the uterus. Also, the oviducts are the primary site of fertilization. The uterus is a chamber capable of enlargement in order to accommodate a developing baby. The cervix secretes mucus to help sperm motility and also serves to help protect the developing fetus from bacterial infections (post-fertilization)."

      "answers": [" The Eustachian tube   "],
      "explanation": "The Eustachian tube runs from the middle ear to the pharynx. When pressure builds inside the ear, the tube helps to circumvent the excess pressure by allowing for equalization of air between the middle ear and the atmosphere. Rapid change in altitude can result in ear 'popping' due to this equalization process. &#10;&#10;The cochlea contains the organ of Corti, which is vital for hearing. &#10;&#10;The utricle is part of the vestibular apparatus and plays an important role in balance and spatial orientation."

From the third ventricle, it flows through the cerebral aqueduct (Sylvian aqueduct) into the fourth ventricle. From the fourth ventricle, CSF passes through the foramina of Luschka (2) and Magendie (1) and enters the subarachnoid space. Some of the CSF flows around the spinal cord and the rest of it bathes the cerebral hemispheres. Absorption of the CSF back into the bloodstream takes place in the superior sagittal sinus through the arachnoid villi. In order for absorption to occur, the CSF pressure must be greater than the venous pressure."

      "options": [" Toxoplasmosis  ", " Onchocerciasis  ", " Toxocariasis   ", " Histoplasmosis  ", " Cysticercosis  "],
      "answers": [" Toxocariasis   "],
      "explanation": "Toxocariasis is caused by the parasite Toxocara canis. This intestinal roundworm is commonly found in dogs and may be present in the feces of infected canines. Toxocariasis may develop in humans via contact with contaminated soil or food. Once the ova are ingested, they may transform into larvae, which can then travel to the rest of the body and infect various organs such as the eyes, liver, brain, lungs, and skin. Once the larvae perish, the body may mount an inflammatory reaction to the remnants of their carcasses. &#10;&#10;Toxoplasmosis is caused by the protozoa Toxoplasma gondii. T. gondii is commonly associated with improper handling of raw meat or cat fecal matter from an animal that has ingested infected meat; however, it rarely leads to illness in healthy individuals. &#10;&#10;Presumed ocular histoplasmosis is caused by the organism Histoplasma capsulatum; it typically enters the body via inhalation into the lungs. This condition is most prominent in the Ohio-Mississippi River valley region and in the southern United States. &#10;&#10;Onchocerciasis, also known as river-blindness, is caused by an infection with Onchocerca volvulus, which is a parasitic helminth. The most common vector responsible for transmission is the black fly. &#10;&#10;Cysticercosis is a parasitic infection in which pigs are the intermediate hosts. Transmission of this disease commonly occurs via the host ingesting cysts of a pork tapeworm (Taenia solium) from contaminated pork meat, vegetables, or water."

      "answers": [" Toxoplasmosis   ", " Rubella   ", " Herpes simplex   ", " Cytomegalovirus   "],
      "explanation": "TORCH is an acronym for a group of perinatal infectious diseases that may cause congenital conditions if a fetus is exposed to them in utero. TORCH stands for: &#10;- T: Toxoplasmosis &#10;- O: Other (such as HIV, varicella, syphilis, mumps, and parvovirus) &#10;- R: Rubella &#10;- C: Cytomegalovirus &#10;- H: Herpes Simplex &#10;&#10;Most of these infections result in only mild complications in the mother; however, they can potentially have serious fetal consequences. Treatment of the infection in the mother typically does not have a significant impact on the fetal sequelae from the infection. Therefore, it is important to recognize the presence of these maternal diseases as early as possible in order to properly and closely monitor the fetus."

      "explanation": "Although a person who suffers from hyperthyroidism may experience abnormal blood glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels, these tests will not definitively aid in a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. A person who has this condition will be expected to have low levels of TSH and increased levels of T3 and free T4. The most commonly ordered test is a measurement of the serum thyroid hormone T4 by radioimmunoassay. Because 80% of the thyroid's output is T4, this test generally gives a good idea of overall thyroid function; however, for a more accurate analysis a measurement of the serum thyroid hormone T3 by radioimmunoassay is also generally ordered in addition to T4 levels because T3 levels will likely also display elevation."

      "options": [" Turner syndrome  ", " Klinefelter syndrome  ", " Down syndrome   ", " Edward syndrome  "],
      "answers": [" Down syndrome   "],
      "explanation": "Down syndrome is considered the most prevalent chromosomal disorder and is the most frequently recognizable cause of mental or intellectual disability. It is caused by extra genetic material on chromosome 21 (also known as trisomy 21). Down syndrome occurs once in about every 700 births, is seen in all ethnic groups, and has a slight predilection for males over females, although this predilection is very small. The most commonly associated risk factor for Down syndrome is increased maternal age, as the chances of having a child with Down syndrome increases significantly with a maternal age of about 35 years and older. &#10;&#10;Turner syndrome is a chromosomal disorder in which all or part of one of the sex chromosomes is missing or abnormal. It typically occurs in about 1 in 2,000 live female births (this number varies slightly according to literature). &#10;&#10;Edward syndrome is a genetic chromosomal disorder cause by the presence of either all or a portion of an extra 18th chromosome (also known as trisomy 18). It occurs in about 1 in 6,000 births. &#10;&#10;Klinefelter syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality that results from additional genetic material on the X chromosome in males (also known as XXY). It exists in roughly 1 in 500 and 1 in 1000 live male births, but many of these males do not show symptoms. If the physical characteristics inherent in this abnormality have not become apparent earlier, they typically appear after the onset of puberty. &#10;&#10;Down Syndrome: The Facts (3rd edition).

      "question": "You present for your annual tuberculin skin test (PPD) that is required once you begin seeing patients in clinic. The nurse explains that you need to return in 48-72 hours in order to read the results of the test. After a couple of days you notice that a large area of induration has formed around the injection site. This finding is due to which of the following types of reactions?",
      "options": [" Type I hypersensitivity  ", " Type II hypersensitivity  ", " Type V hypersensitivity  ", " Type III hypersensitivity  ", " Type IV hypersensitivity   "],
      "answers": [" Type IV hypersensitivity   "],
      "explanation": "In patients with no known risks of tuberculosis (TB), a 15mm diameter (or more) area of firm swelling at the injection site indicates a positive result. This reaction that occurs in the skin is an example of a delayed (type IV) hypersensitivity reaction. The test can be positive within 4 weeks after exposure to the mycobacterium, although a positive skin test does not always mean that a person has active TB. &#10;&#10;In other populations, smaller reactions (such as 5mm or 10mm diameter areas) can be considered a positive result. These are typically people who are healthcare workers, HIV-positive, have had an organ transplant, injection drug users, or children, among others."

      "answers": [" Type IV Hypersensitivity   "],
      "explanation": "According to the Gell and Coombs classification of hypersensitivity reactions, Type I reactions are IgE-mediated reactions that result in an immediate response occuring within minutes of exposure. This type of reaction is seen in allergic disease. Type II reactions are antibody-dependent cytotoxic reactions that are mediated by IgM/IgG and complement. Type III reactions are due to immune complex formation. Immune complex diseases include systemic lupus erythematosus, arthus reactions and serum sickness. Type IV hypersensitivity is delayed-type hypersensitivity and is the result of T lymphocyte response. Typically, symptoms will occur 2 days after exposure. Prime examples include the PPD test for TB, contact dermatitis, and chronic organ transplant rejection."

      "answers": [" Type O   "],
      "explanation": "A person who has type A blood has A markers on their red blood cells and therefore does not possess antibodies against A markers but does manufacture antibodies for B markers. This individual can receive a transfusion from type O blood as red blood cells of this type do not display any markers and therefore do not result in antibody production. &#10;&#10;A person who has type B blood can receive type B and type O blood but not type A because they possess antibodies for the A markers. &#10;&#10;A person who has type AB blood can receive blood from types A, B, AB, and O. Type AB is considered the universal recipient because they will not surmount an immune reaction to any type of blood. &#10;&#10;A person with type O blood is considered the universal donor (an easy way to remember this is that dOnor has an O in it!). Individuals with type O blood can only receive type O blood because they carry antibodies against both the A and B markers. &#10;&#10;If two incompatible blood types are mixed, agglutination or clumping of the blood will occur, which can block blood vessels and lead to damage of the tissues and/or death.&#10;PowerPage&#10;Blood Typing"

      "answers": [" Uhthoff's phenomenon   "],
      "explanation": "Some patients with multiple sclerosis (or other demyelinating diseases) experience deterioration of their vision during physical activity, or any other activity in which a rise in body temperature occurs (hot shower/bath, illness, stress, etc.). The observable changes in vision can range from blurriness to double vision or blind spots within the patient's visual field. These symptoms are temporary and reversible once the body temperature returns back to normal levels. Uhthoff's phenomenon is typically seen in about 4% of patients with demyelinating disease and can also include other transient neurological deficits such as muscle weakness, severe fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. This phenomenon is thought to be due to an interference in nerve conduction secondary to an intolerance to heat (but the exact cause is still controversial)."

      "answers": [" Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL)   "],
      "explanation": "The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory Test (VDRL) is a non-treponemal serological test for syphilis. It is designed to test whether a patient is currently infected with the Treponema palladium organism. VDRL is useful for monitoring a patient's response to medical treatment because the values will wane with successful treatment of the condition. &#10;&#10;Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption assay (FTA-ABS) is a treponemal test for syphilis. This serological test will produce a positive result in patients who are currently or have previously been infected with the T. palladium organism. Therefore, this test is not valuable for follow-up therapy because it will continue to be positive for the life of the patient, even after successful treatment. &#10;&#10;Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are helpful in the diagnosis of certain conditions such as toxoplasmosis, cat-scratch disease, and toxocariasis. It has no use in diagnosing or monitoring syphilis. &#10;&#10;Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is mainly utilized to identify antibodies that target normal proteins within the nuclei of cells in the body. A positive test typically indicates the presence of an autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, Sjogren's syndrome, and juvenile arthritis."

      "answers": [" Via secretion of interleukins   "],
      "explanation": "In response to binding with an antigen-MHC complex (major histocompatibility complex), a helper T cell will secrete interleukins and stimulate mitosis of cytotoxic T cells and helper T cells to produce an army of memory T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and helper T cells. &#10;&#10;Prostaglandin release is associated with inflammation and the pain pathway but is produced by all cells that contain a nucleus except for lymphocytes. &#10;&#10;Cytotoxic T cells secrete perforins to destroy pathogens. The release of perforins causes the formation of holes in the plasma membranes of infected cells, resulting in death. &#10;&#10;Histamine is released by mast cells and basophils in response to inflammatory conditions. Histamine causes vasodilation of arterioles, leading to blood engorgement (hence the redness experienced during an infection). Vasodilation occurs when the smooth muscle that lines the blood vessels relaxes. Histamine also promotes increased capillary permeability, causing the vessels to leak water and solutes, which produces localized edema."

Homocysteine is a metabolic product of the metabolism of methionine. It is associated with premature atherosclerosis and thrombotic complications such as thrombophlebitis. There is great excitement in the medical community about the ability of B vitamins to reduce homocysteine levels; they have been found to do so in multiple studies. Unfortunately, a reduction in cardiovascular disease has not occurred as a consequence of the reduction in this risk factor. It is probably appropriate to maintain homocysteine within a healthy range by restricting foods that are high in methionine and by maintaining an adequate supply of these B Vitamins."

      "answers": [" The magnification will decrease, and the field of view will increase   "],
      "explanation": "As the power of the condensing lens increases, the field of view increases but the magnification decreases. Additionally, the working distance will decrease as well. &#10;&#10;It may be easier to think about this concept in terms of fundus lenses because we commonly switch back and forth between powers depending on pupil size, while most practitioners only use one condensing lens (20D). The field of view is larger with a 90D lens, and the magnification is less with a 90D lens as compared to a 78D lens; this can be applied to condensing lenses used with binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy as well."
