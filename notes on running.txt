To run the docker container you need to clone the respository and then run 

You need to create and add a .env file

docker-compose up -d


If you need to reset a docker-build then you need to remove the docker image and container and rebuild it 

Stop the container
sudo docker-compose down

This removes the container (named "next-tester)
sudo docker-compose rm -f next-tester

This rebuilds the container again
sudo docker-compose up --build
